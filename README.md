Social data analysis, building a food and food influencer recommender, a must have for your food business!

## Background

Singapore is an [international food paradise](https:/www.straitstimes.com%2Fopinion%2Fglobal-city-foodies-paradise) with a [billion-dollar food industry](https://foodindustry.asia/the-food-industry-a-strong-contributor-to-singapores-economy). The food industry in Singapore is worth S$8.3 billion in annual receipts and makes S$4.3 billion annual contribution to the country's GDP with 48,000 workers employed. According to the Ministry of Trade & Industry's (MTI) [Food Industry Transformation Map](https://www.enterprisesg.gov.sg%2Findustries%2Ftype%2Ffood-manufacturing%2Findustry-profile), there is a 4.5% of productivity growth and 2,000 new jobs planned for 2020. This makes Singapore's food industry an attractive sector for budding entrepreneurs.

## Problem

Due to the current COVID-19 pandemic, a lot of usual businesses eg. manufacturing, offices, are suffering. In order to help them, we want to identify a promising industry for them to start a new business.

Furthermore, as a [result of the COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/southeast-asia/article/3081906/coronavirus-singapores-home-based-food-businesses-hit-hard) and in its [aftermath](https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/fb-sales-fall-april-amid-circuit-breaker-some-restaurants-choose-close-shop-good), existing food businesses are hard pressed to reconsider their offerings and business strategy in order to amass enough sales to [keep up or fall out](https://vulcanpost.com/700385/fb-businesses-closed-down-singapore/) of the race.

This can be done by:

1. Making personalised recommendations on trending food for businesses to sell
2. Making personalised recommendations on relevant influencers to engage in promoting their businesses and food

## Brief Workflow

1. Instagram Scraping
2. Corpus Creation
3. Sentiment Analysis
4. Food/Cuisine and Influencers Analysis
5. Social Network Analysis

## Outcomes

- Data visualisation dashboards for new and existing business owners who are interested in the food industry
- Social Network Graph

## Dataset Used

- [Instagram scrapes](https://github.com/terenceneo/Social-Analytics/tree/master/Instagram) of posts from the top 12 food influencers in Singapore from 30th May to 30th June 2020
