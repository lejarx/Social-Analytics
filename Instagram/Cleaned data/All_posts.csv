The nutrient-dense Hakka dish was purportedly created during the warring Three Kingdoms period in China to nourish soldiers and keep them healthy. While assorted chopped veg, tofu & rice drenched in a tea and herb soup might not sound like the stuff of which foodie dreams are made, a well made bowl of thunder tea rice is a joy to eat. Fresh, healthful and flavour-packed. Click story link in our profile to find out where to get a great bowl. 📹@flofongsg .

14/6/2020,8days_eat,"Utterly delicious find: we’ve been hooked on this dairy-free cempedak cake with islandwide delivery from @ollella_singapore (feeds four to six pax). It’s fluffy and fragrant with pongy, juicy fresh cempedak slices baked into the cake. Tip: heat it up it in your oven/ toaster oven for a bit before you dig in, for maximum shiokness. We got our cake sometime ago, when durian cempedaks (characterised by golden, flattish flesh) were in season. We have since found out from Ollella’s owner that the type of cempedaks used for the cake vary according to the time of the year you order. Currently, the shop is using cempedak nangka, which has plumper, heavier flesh and does not nestle as neatly in the sponge cake as durian cempedak does. 📷: @yipjieying_

13/6/2020,8days_eat,"Mostly sweet and a little bit salty — no, not your bf/gf but @benandjerrysg’s new collab flavour with @netflixsg called Chip Happens. It’s inspired by Netflix’s amateur baking original reality series @nailedit (go watch it, it’s hilarious). And like the wacky, disaster-prone show, this flavour anyhow-ly combines choc ice cream, fudge chips and “potato chip swirls”. While we like the good quality choc ice cream enough, the salty chip swirls did not “nail it” (it tastes a little of stale grease). Ben & Jerry’s also sent us some surprisingly yummy bacon blondies by food Instagrammer @chockywoky, along with a liquid cheesecake topping, to make our own dessert with the new ice cream. The result tastes better than it sounds.

1/6/2020,8days_eat,"One of the best DIY kits @flofongsg received during the CB is from @buonaterrasg. The texture & flavour of the fresh handmade semolina & saffron pastas are impeccable. Of the 3 options, her fave was the king crabmeat with tomato & tagliatelle. It looked deceptively light but turned out to be an umami bomb, saturating the springy strands of pasta with flavours as deep as the ocean. This was closely followed by the amatriciana with pappardelle - the guanciale (cured pork jowl) and pecorino cheese added a savoury sock to the rich tomato sauce, which clung to the satiny pasta sheets deliciously. Assembly is simple enough - think a more atas version of instant noodle prep with some emphasis on timing & a bit of multitasking: heat sauce in a pan, boil pasta with salted water, throw pasta in sauce along with some fruity olive oil & perhaps cheese, toss, dig in. The necessary ingredients are provided so all you need to do is follow the instructions dutifully & it’s ready to eat in minutes. Yum .

30/6/2020,danielfooddiary,"Just finished writing about Serangoon Garden Food Centre, the hawker centre VERY far away from me - but I made multiple trips there and was one of the last I went to before the CB started. 
Now if you ask me what I miss most there, it would have to be those Luncheon Meat buns. 
So old school and simple.

I realised there is something that dabao cannot satisfy, that freshness, buttery aroma and the warm soft feeling when you hold the bread in your hands. 
And uncle making those sounds as he closes and opens the plastic shelves. Piak, piak, piak. 
Things I miss, just sitting at the food centre and eating a bun. Haha. Happiness can come in small bites.

30/6/2020,danielfooddiary,"On the 26th of May 2008, 12 years ago, I started something called “Daniel’s Food Diary”. Seriously speaking, I didn’t have a plan as friends just wanted me to document what I ate every day. Therefore, “food diary”. I had a curious mind (and appetite) and loved discovering new food places. 
If you asked me what I regretted, it would probably be the very name of the website - I was in a rush to just register something, and url like “The Food Diary” and “SG Food Diary” were taken. 
I didn’t think I was particularly a good food person, writer or photographer (though not many would know I majored in video and film in school). But Moses Lim told me something, “If you don’t know how this dish of Char Kway Teow is, after eating 20-30 plates of others, you would know.” The more you do, the better you get. 
With that in mind, I visited every new cafe in Singapore, tried a different hawker stall every single day. 
There are now more than 4200 posts on DFD.

Eventually all the food invites came - so many it became overwhelming and stressful, then I felt more at ease visiting food places anonymously and paying for my own meals.

Frankly speaking, it is not difficult to start something this day and age, like a blog or business. Startups are celebrated, but people don’t tell you how to sustain it. 
Nobody told me going on, being consistent, and never giving up would be this difficult.

How to keep going? 
Continue learning new things (esp from the young people), never think you are the best, cannot be complacent, and keep a curious mind. And of course, must enjoy what you do. It shows. 
12 years. I still feel fresh and young with so much to learn. Thank you for your support, your patience, and having me as part of your food decisions.

23/6/2020,danielfooddiary,"Have you considered making your own New York Style Cheesecake?

This is a simple cheesecake recipe you can follow: New York Cheesecake made with Philadelphia Cream Cheese.

A classic pairing of cheese cake with biscuit crust base, plus deliciously sweetened sour cream layer.

Ingredients
Cream Cheese Block, softened – 250g x 2 blocks
Sourcream – 2 cups
Digestive biscuits – 1 cup
Butter (unsalted) – 1/3 cup or 75g
Brown Sugar – 20g
White Sugar – 150g
Eggs, lightly beaten – 2

Others:
Fresh strawberries sliced, blueberries and mint leaves for garnishing

Steps 
1. Pre-heat oven to 150°C
2. Line pan with foil, with ends of foil extending over sides (if you are using a usual baking tray). Alternatively, many cheesecake recipes and hacks suggest wrapping foil outside the baking. This is so as to prevent the outer layer from over-heating, and prevent water from seeping in if using a water bath during bake.
3. Mix digestive biscuits, butter and 20g brown sugar
4. Press biscuit crumbs and butter base onto bottom of pan. Chill.

5. Beat PHILLY cream cheese, 100g white sugar with mixer until blended.
6. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating on low speed after each just until blended.
7. Pour mixture over crust.
8. Bake 60 min at 150°C or until center is almost set.

9. Mix 2 cups sour cream with remaining 50g sugar until dissovled; carefully spread over cheesecake. Bake 10-15 min or until set.
10. Refrigerate 3 hours.
11. Use foil handles to lift cheesecake from pan (if you are using a normal baking pan – see below), before cutting to serve.
12. Top with strawberries, blueberries and mint.

21/6/2020,danielfooddiary,"Chris Kway Chap 瑞庆粿汁 at Bedok 216 could very well be a top contender for the best Kway Chap in Singapore.

This highly-recommended stall often attracts long line once it opens at 8am in the morning, and till 2pm or sold out.

Here’s another catch: the stall only operates from Thursday to Sundays.

The secret comes the seemingly bottomless pot, simmering a well-balanced braising liquid – it is both sweet and savoury and carries herbal notes.

All ingredients, from thoroughly cleaned intestines to pork belly, are braised for hours in this potent pot of umami flavour.

Another secret to its success is that Chris is particular about keeping all the intestine and parts clean, and braises them separately (rather than dump them together in a pot). This is also to maintain consistency and so that each item maintains an optimum texture and ‘cleanliness’. Some day, some day I shall have this again.

I waited anxiously, then I got my confirmation one night at 12:30am. LOL

Dirty Buns is a new burger stall located at City Sprouts at 102 Henderson Road – no signage, no Facebook what-so-ever, yet.

The menu is really straight-forward, with DB Classic Single at $8 or $11 for a set with fries and Coke; Double Patty at $11 or $14 for the set.

Between the two, I would say just go for the “Dirty Double” rather than the single patty.

The meat to bun proportion felt more balanced, and somehow the single patty tasted overwhelmed by the cheese and sauces.

The star of the burger was indeed the meat patties – nothing extraordinary, but good-old juicy, flavourful beef patties. Better than some of the expensive brands, really.

While cakes are typically the sweet treat that we look forward to having, I thought of focusing on cake cafes and patisseries in Singapore specialising in tarts.

A tart is typically baked consisting of a pastry base, filled with fruits, custard, chocolate and the likes.

There are some topped with boba pearls and Orh Nee. 
Here are some places in Singapore where you can find delicious tarts: bit.ly/tartssg

Loyal followers would know it is owned and run by a 70 plus year old hawker, an affectionate auntie named Mdm Tan. For more than 40 years, she has served hundreds of diners and now her son, Jay Lim is helping her out.

Hua Kee at 85 Redhill Food Centre is no-frills hawker stall with a red signboard, a favoured lunch spot among locals, has a two-items menu: Chicken Rice ($4, $5) and Poached Chicken ($15 for half, $28 for whole). What gives the chicken meat its mild flavour is the blend of light soy sauce and chicken broth that serves as poaching liquid.

The poached chicken was not overly greasy or saucy, in fact still tasted slightly ‘cold’, but had this smoothness which was quite alluring that I enjoyed very much.

Islandwide delivery is available. 
The Impossible meat focused food truck serves up a number of burgers, such as The Classic ($16), Black Tie which includes truffle aioli ($18), a Thai-inspired One Night in Bangkok ($20), and Happy Days ($20) included with BBQ sauce.

Because of the richness of the cheese and aioli, if you take a bite, you may not have thought this isn’t beef.

But if you take the time to slowly savour, then there is that juiciness, ‘beefy’ bite and deeper flavour missing.

Overall, one of the better Impossible Burgers I tried out there.

Instructions:
1. Add 2-3 teaspoons of yuzu concentrate to a tall glass.

2. Add some ice cubes (say 6-8 cubes). 3. Pour in around 200ml of tonic water.

4. Add in a shot of espresso (which is about 30ml). You may want a stronger mix with double shot.

5. You may want to further garnish with mint leaves, and enjoy this super refreshing drink on a hot afternoon.

Iced coffee pairs so well with citrus fruits and yuzu gives it a unique bitter-sweet flavour. You can also replace with other citron-jam or fruits & zest.

Why does this feel ions ago? 
The lesson learnt, not to take simple pleasures like dining out for a zi char meal together for granted. 
How many times have we said “sorry busy”, “no time” and declined that meal? 
Anyway, this is a Wong Po Lou Meen aka Yellow Cloth Noodles from Quan Ji at Amoy Street Food Centre.

Made with thin egg noodles – choose between sheng main (raw noodles) and lou mien tossed in oyster sauce and lard, then topped with a silky-soft omelette, plump prawns, and blanched chye sim on the side.

7/6/2020,danielfooddiary,"After covering quite a number of the more famous hawker centres in Singapore, I made it a point to explore some of the less-covered food centres this year.

This ‘mission’ brought me to Empress Place Food Centre, also known to many as Farrer Road Food Centre due to its prime location at the road with the same name.

But it is not as talk-about and may even miss it if you drive past. I wont’ be surprised if many of the younger Singaporeans have never heard of this food centre before.

Some of the stalls here include:
- Happy World Delicacy 好世界美食 for Roast Meats
- Ah Wing Wanton Mee
- Poh for Chye Poh Horfun
- Heng Heng Nasi Lemak 興興椰漿飯 - Fu Gui 富贵 for Fishball Meepok
- Bunga Raya Prata Hut
- Yu Kee House Of Braised Duck 友记卤鸭之家

6/6/2020,danielfooddiary,"Probably one of the best Hainanese Western food in Singapore. 
While the stall only opens at 7pm or so, you may see a line forming here from 6:30pm or even earlier.

Nestled in the Tanglin Halt Hawker Centre, this is one of the most visited stalls for dinner, and for a very good reason.

Their Mixed Grill Platters ($10) are very popular, which offers a serving of pork chop, tender chicken chops, fish cutlet and chicken sausage.

Along with the meats, there was a dollop of coleslaw, baked beans, baked potato and crinkle cut fries. It’s a lot for one person, so make sure you bring your appetite with you.

Old-school flavours, generous portion, the only thing holding me back is the long queue and longer wait.

5/6/2020,danielfooddiary,"Roti Prata is a well-loved hawker food in Singapore. Also known as “roti canai” in other parts of Southeast Asia, the Indian-influenced flatbread dish is usually served with curry or dal.

Roti means ‘bread’, and Prata or paratha means ‘flat’ in Hindi language.

It is South-Indian flat bread made by frying stretched dough flavoured with ghee (Indian clarified butter), typically served with fish or mutton curry.

However, you do find more creative savoury and sweet variations, filled with cheese, bananas, or even chocolate.

The prata is typically crispy outside and doughy inside, making it a flexible choice for breakfast, lunch, snack, or supper (I usually have it for breakfast or supper – it just tastes ‘better’.)

Anyway, Teochew rice porridge dish is often accompanied with various small plates of side dishes. 

The porridge is watery and cooked with minimal seasoning, and I usually order porridge water “um” because I can not afford anymore carbs.

Some of the dishes are saltier in nature, like minced meat, braised pork belly, spicy shrimps and salted egg. 

But you can always pair with lighter dishes like steamed egg, steamed fish and vegetables. 

I like my dishes warm and flavourful. Sometimes, some popular stalls are a matter of hits and misses, and what time is the day you go to.

The humble shop at 10 Cavan Road (at Jalan Besar) with limited sitting outside churns out small batch flavours through a constant process of experimentation and refinement.

The Pistachio gelato was indeed rich, indulgent and had a dense consistency, with delicate roasted flavour without that artificial tasting sweetness. Good stuff.

However, when paired with a lavender-flavoured cone, the gelato flavour overwhelmed the faint aroma totally.

They asked me for another flavour suggestion for the cone. I thought maybe black sesame?

But I decided to give R&B Express at Newton Hawker Centre a try. Since it has a Michelin recommendation. 
Have to say these were decent barbecued chicken wings – evenly grilled till there was that enticing brown colour, thin and lightly-crisp skin, and moderately juicy on the inside.

The accompanying chilli sauce with its tanginess helped ‘lift’ up the taste.

But not sure if they are the best around. Most of the BBQ chicken wings around 都差不多  more or less the same. No? 
It’s usually the chilli that makes the difference.

This is from Dong Fang Hong. 
There are two styles here – the Dong Fang Hong Jajang ($12) is the more basic bowl, and Bai Nian Jajang ($15) which literally means “hundred years” and said to contain a traditional and authentic taste.

The Jjajangmyeon is indeed one of the best version I had in Singapore, drenched over in a rich and earthy-tasting thick sauce. If only the sauce could be warmer.

One of the most popular stalls in Serangoon Garden Food Centre, Garden Street Kway Chap is known for its diners lining up to buy their highly rated kway (rice noodle sheets) and braised meats.

Founded in the 1940s by the late Mr. Koh, it has been run by grandson Jason since 2005.

Jason has occasionally been featured in TV programmes as he was a qualified pilot before deciding to take over the stall.

The boiled flat rice sheets aka kueh were delicately smooth, silky and not unpleasantly too thick.

The brown soup base, made with from a home recipe of 15 ingredients, is boiled for at least 2 hours to develop its robust, herbal taste.

Their kway chap has a noticeably lighter flavour compared to other stalls.

These cute Chili Crab Bao Kit ($15.90) and the Salted Egg Chicken Bao Kit ($13.90) from Bao Makers just need a quick run in the steamer, airfryer, or microwave and they’re ready to be assembled.

Paradise Dynasty’s DIY Xiao Long Bao Kit ($23.80) set comes with colourful XLB skin, juicy pork filling, and even a bamboo steamer—everything you need to fulfil your XLB dreams at home.

The brown rice-fed Benja Chicken from UFarm is marinated with a fragrant blend of Asian spices, so all you need to do is grill it up. For a quick fix, just order these juicy chunks of chicken in Route 65’s newest dish: Boneless Kampung Grilled Chicken Leg.

18/6/2020,eatbooksg,"Chewy, chocolatey, and filled with Milo, there’s nothing more to ask from a sweet snack that can be easily whipped up in the kitchen. These pliable Milo Mochi pieces have a molten Milo centre, encased in a soft mochi skin. If you have spare glutinous rice flour from making rice cooker muah chee, this bite-sized dessert makes an easy sugar fix.

Milo Filling:
200g Milo powder
6 tbsp condensed milk

Mochi:
150g glutinous rice flour
90g sugar 
1g salt
220g hot water
1g Milo powder 
Cornstarch
Milo powder

Steps:
1. Prepare your filling by mixing Milo powder with condensed milk. Stir well, then using your hands, bring it together into a dough.
2. Pluck out teaspoon-large pieces of the dough, and roll them into balls. Set aside. 
3. In a microwavable bowl, whisk together the glutinous rice flour, sugar, and salt.
4. Combine Milo powder with hot water. Add the Milo to the mixture of flour, sugar, and salt. Mix well.
5. Cover the bowl with cling wrap and microwave for 90 seconds. Take it out and give it another good mix, before popping it back in the microwave for another 90 seconds.
6. Mix it again in the bowl and let the mochi cool down.
7. On a surface covered with cornstarch, scoop your mochi out and dust it well with more cornstarch. Mould it into a rectangle, and cut the mochi into 12 equal pieces.
8. Flatten each piece of mochi and place a ball of filling in the centre. Pinch the mochi dough together to seal the filling in.
9. Dust the mochi pieces with Milo powder and serve.

16/6/2020,eatbooksg,"This pretty three-coloured sandwich was inspired by @Maangchi’s famous ‘Samsaek Sandwich’, a recipe which she recalled from her nostalgic university days. Read on for the recipe to this hearty and visually satisfying sandwich!

Ingredients:
12 slices bread
1 cucumber, finely diced
½ tsp salt
2-3 tbsp mayonnaise
Black pepper
4 hard-boiled egg yolks
2-3 tbsp mayonnaise
1 tbsp yellow mustard
4 ham slices
2-3 tbsp mayonnaise

Steps:
1. In a bowl, toss salt and finely diced cucumber and let it sit for 10 to 15 minutes, or until they sweat and release moisture.
2. Using a kitchen towel or clean cotton cloth, pat or squeeze out excess moisture from the cucumber.
3. In a dry bowl, combine the cucumber with pepper and mayonnaise.
4. In a separate bowl, prepare the yellow filling by mixing the egg yolks, mayonnaise, and yellow mustard together.
5. For the red filling, pat the slices of ham dry and finely dice it. Combine the diced ham with mayonnaise.
6. Assemble the sandwich by laying a slice of bread down and spreading an even layer of the yellow filling, followed by a slice of bread and red filling, and another slice of bread with the green filling. Complete the sandwich with a final piece of bread.
7. Using a serrated-edge or bread knife, cut the bread crust off the sides, then cut the sandwich in half.
8. Repeat two more times with the rest of the sandwich fillings.

It’s surprisingly easy to recreate this crispy, Milo-coated treat at home, so read on for the full recipe!

Ingredients:
2 chicken breast, cut into strips
Salt
Pepper
½ cup flour
2 eggs, beaten
2 cups fine breadcrumbs

Condensed milk
Milo powder

Steps:
1. In a large bowl, season the chicken strips well with salt and pepper.
2. Prepare a tray of flour, a bowl of beaten eggs, and a bowl of fine breadcrumbs. Dredge each chicken strip in flour, then dip them in beaten eggs, and finally coat them in fine breadcrumbs.
3. Preheat a pot of oil to about 190°C, or until the oil starts steadily bubbling when a wooden chopstick is dipped in. Fry the breaded chicken strips for two to three minutes, or until golden brown. 
4. Let the fried chicken strips cool on paper towels for a few minutes. Drizzle lightly with condensed milk, then dust generously with Milo powder, coating all sides of each chicken strip.
5. Serve with a small saucer of condensed milk and Milo powder on the side.

These pliable Milo Mochi pieces have a molten Milo centre, encased in a soft mochi skin. If you have spare glutinous rice flour from making rice cooker muah chee, this bite-sized dessert makes an easy sugar fix.

Milo Filling:
200g Milo powder
6 tbsp condensed milk

Mochi:
150g glutinous rice flour
90g sugar 
1g salt
220g hot water
1g Milo powder 
Cornstarch
Milo powder

Steps:
1. Prepare your filling by mixing Milo powder with condensed milk. Stir well, then using your hands, bring it together into a dough.
2. Pluck out teaspoon-large pieces of the dough, and roll them into balls. Set aside. 
3. In a microwavable bowl, whisk together the glutinous rice flour, sugar, and salt.
4. Combine Milo powder with hot water. Add the Milo to the mixture of flour, sugar, and salt. Mix well.
5. Cover the bowl with cling wrap and microwave for 90 seconds. Take it out and give it another good mix, before popping it back in the microwave for another 90 seconds.
6. Mix it again in the bowl and let the mochi cool down.
7. On a surface covered with cornstarch, scoop your mochi out and dust it well with more cornstarch. Mould it into a rectangle, and cut the mochi into 12 equal pieces.
8. Flatten each piece of mochi and place a ball of filling in the centre. Pinch the mochi dough together to seal the filling in.
9. Dust the mochi pieces with Milo powder and serve.

16/6/2020,eatbooksg,"This pretty three-coloured sandwich was inspired by @Maangchi’s famous ‘Samsaek Sandwich’, a recipe which she recalled from her nostalgic university days. Read on for the recipe to this hearty and visually satisfying sandwich!

Ingredients:
12 slices bread
1 cucumber, finely diced
½ tsp salt
2-3 tbsp mayonnaise
Black pepper
4 hard-boiled egg yolks
2-3 tbsp mayonnaise
1 tbsp yellow mustard
4 ham slices
2-3 tbsp mayonnaise

Steps:
1. In a bowl, toss salt and finely diced cucumber and let it sit for 10 to 15 minutes, or until they sweat and release moisture.
2. Using a kitchen towel or clean cotton cloth, pat or squeeze out excess moisture from the cucumber.
3. In a dry bowl, combine the cucumber with pepper and mayonnaise.
4. In a separate bowl, prepare the yellow filling by mixing the egg yolks, mayonnaise, and yellow mustard together.
5. For the red filling, pat the slices of ham dry and finely dice it. Combine the diced ham with mayonnaise.
6. Assemble the sandwich by laying a slice of bread down and spreading an even layer of the yellow filling, followed by a slice of bread and red filling, and another slice of bread with the green filling. Complete the sandwich with a final piece of bread.
7. Using a serrated-edge or bread knife, cut the bread crust off the sides, then cut the sandwich in half.
8. Repeat two more times with the rest of the sandwich fillings.

Ingredients:
2 chicken breast, cut into strips
Salt
Pepper
½ cup flour
2 eggs, beaten
2 cups fine breadcrumbs

Condensed milk
Milo powder

Steps:
1. In a large bowl, season the chicken strips well with salt and pepper.
2. Prepare a tray of flour, a bowl of beaten eggs, and a bowl of fine breadcrumbs. Dredge each chicken strip in flour, then dip them in beaten eggs, and finally coat them in fine breadcrumbs.
3. Preheat a pot of oil to about 190°C, or until the oil starts steadily bubbling when a wooden chopstick is dipped in. Fry the breaded chicken strips for two to three minutes, or until golden brown. 
4. Let the fried chicken strips cool on paper towels for a few minutes. Drizzle lightly with condensed milk, then dust generously with Milo powder, coating all sides of each chicken strip.
5. Serve with a small saucer of condensed milk and Milo powder on the side.

1/6/2020,eatbooksg,"Instead of going on yet another fast food run, try these hawker delivery options for a cheap and good burger fix.

The halal chicken burgers from Hot Chick Buns is truly one of a kind. Their Hot Ass-am ($9.45) features charcoal buns sandwiching a succulent fried chicken, blanketed by melty cheese and a tangy assam pedas paste. The stall delivers islandwide via food delivery platforms.

Forget mass-processed fast food, Zipp Burger & Pasta’s wallet-friendly burgers are all hand-moulded with care. Get the Pork Burger ($5.70) or Double Patty Burger ($8.70) for a taste of their hefty, fried pork patty. Delivery fees range from $5 to $10, depending on your location.

Wok In Burger serves unique fusion creations, including a huge Salted Egg Soft Shell Crab Burger ($16.80), as well as a caffeine-infused Coffee Pork Burger ($11.80). There is a minimum order of $50 for delivery, and a flat delivery fee of $5 islandwide.

30/6/2020,foodkingnoc,"Missing the prawn tang hoon from @87justthai that we had in our last Thai episode!! Really a flavour packed dish like @helloshaunsim mentioned. 

If you try out our recommendations, tag us at #FKTagUsTuesday and we’ll repost it! Today’s one is from @helloshaunsim:

The fiancée ordered from @87justthai for Father’s Day dinner!

We had the Basil Pork with Century Egg, Claypot Tang Hoon with Prawn, Phad Thai, Clear Tomyum Seafood Soup, Deep Fried squid w/ Thai chilli sauce, Thai Style Kang Kong, Deep Fried Pork with Garlic, Mango Sticky Rice and Red Ruby.

From the plethora of dishes we had, my favourite would be the Tang Hoon! It was very flavourful and well executed. The fried century egg was something I have never tried and I think it’s quite interesting! @foodkingnoc good indeed! The Kang kong was great too!

However, their deep fried items were overly done, imo. The pork was really tough and lacklustre while the squid was overcooked.

But overall, a really decent meal! And I would want to dine in at the place to have the food freshly cooked and piping hot which I suspect would elevate the tastes of the dishes.

The prices are very reasonable too! Head over to @87justthai to check out their menu.",1265,7,"['stop making me hungry now all im thinking about is food', 'Thanks for the feature, @foodkingnoc!', 'This looks amazing *cues welcome to Thailand song 😂', 'Thanks @helloshaunsim and @foodkingnoc!

But the ease of preparation and the freshness of the meal kits along with a certain air of sponatenity just made for such a convincing sales pitch.

I especially love the Thai chili lime Seabass, out of a bag and on the table in under 15 minutes.  It is steamed with various herbs and spices together with a convivial mix of soy sauce, sugar and lime juice for a feisty tangy and spicy affair that will cause instant salivation. Suggestion: steam some rice vermicelli in the broth below for an all-rounded meal.

Less than 20 minutes to get a picture-perfect semblance of a nutritious homecooked meal on the table, without any wastage or both time and resources.

Highly recommended if not for its taste, then for its reasonable price point. Good job guys.

30/6/2020,fundamentally_flawed,"Call me irresponsible for unleashing this sweetness into the family home. Even I fear the consequences of this love affair ~ Peanut Butter Rolls to indulge my love for brown, caramel and shades of coffee.

More than just cinnamon rolls, the blank canvas allows for an exhaustive list of spread interventions. Today, the subject matter is @fixandfogg fruit toast Peanut Butter which is a (@mathieumusnier) fantasy mix of crunchy PB, freeze dried braeburn apples, raisins and sultanas. A good upgrade from the usual smooth peanut butter filling for this scroll.

Peanut Butter Scrolls
Makes 9

Dough
3/4 cup warm water
1/2 cup sugar
7g dry yeast
1/3 cup oil
1/4 cup buttermilk
1 egg
1/2 TSP salt
4 cups of all purpose flour

Combine all 2 cups of flour with the rest of the dry ingredients into a mixing bowl and with your fingers make sure that everything is mixed. Pour in the wet ingredients and on slow speed, mix with a dough hook. Continue to incorporate the rest of the flour bit by bit till a dough ball is formed, one that peels away from the sides.

Leave the dough ball to rest in an oiled bowl for 2 hours or overnight in the fridge.

Filling

120g brown sugar
110g butter, unsalted
180g @fixandfogg Fruit Toast PB

Mix thé Brown sugar and butter till light and aerated. Using a spatula, mix in the peanut butter till you get a smooth paste. Note that it won't technically be smooth since there are sultanas and raisins in the product.

Beat down the dough to expel the air. Roll out into a rectangle on your workbench. Spread the filling out evenly, leaving a margin of about 1/2 inch on the furthest edge. Roll up nice and tight. Trim off the edges. Slice the roll into 9 equal lengths and arrange on a buttered 9 inch square tray. Leave to proof for a second time for about 40 mins or till double in size. May vary in different climate conditions.

Bake for 25 minutes at 180°C.

Drizzle a Nutella glaze over (equal part Nutella and milk) to really push this over the edge. DAYUM.

29/6/2020,fundamentally_flawed,"Who remembers outings to NYDC for baked rice and mudpies during your youth. Oh the excitement and the cheap thrills that rings in.

Today's lunch is inspired by those memories, albeit in a bid to enliven those leftover ribs meat that I extracted from last night's meal with @sousvidelicious 🧡~ : Cheesy Tomato Baked Rice:: and by gosh, with a bit of doctoring, those same flavours will still cling to your tastebuds like crack.

Cheesy Tomato Baked Rice
Makes enough for 2

1.5 cup rice cooked
200g pork ribs, cooked
1 tomato, chopped
1/2 carrot, diced
1 clove garlic, chopped finely
4 rashes of bacon, chopped
2 tablespoon tomato puree/ Passata
1/4 cream/ milk
Black pepper and salt to season
1/2 cup cheese

In a skillet with a little olive oil, render your bacon till slightly crispy. Fry your garlic together. Add your carrots and toss to coat. Cook for a minute on medium-high heat. Add in the tomatoes and fry for another minute. Add your pork ribs or leftover minced pork, you can add in raw pork/beef here too but note to fry if off a little longer. Add in your tomato puree and black pepper.

In goes the rice. Make sure to toss till every grain is imbued with a shy shade of pink from the tomato. Now add in the milk/cream (it's optional, but I really like the rice a bit creamier). Season to taste.

Layer it into a pyrex pan and pre-heat your oven to 180°C. Top the rice with cheese and build a little loose tent for your baked rice, making sure that it is tall enough such that it doesn't touch the cheese.

Bake covered for 20 minutes. Remove the foil tent and bake for another 10 minutes till brown and bubbly.

Remove from oven. Cool slightly before digging in.

Salted Egg Chicken
Makes enough for 2

400g of chicken thigh, boneless, cut into chunks
2 salted duck eggs
1 cup rice flour
2 tablespoon flour
1 Tablespoon rice wine
Salt & pepper
2 tablespoon cornstarch
2 egg yolks

2 tablespoon butter
Handful of curry leaves
80ml evaporated milk, more if you like it saucy
2 cloves garlic, finely minced
2 chili padi, chopped

Steam or boil your salted duck eggs. Boiling should require around 15 minutes. After which seperate the yolks from the whites. Place in a bowl and mash till you get really tiny crumbs.

Marinade your chopped chicken with the rice wine, salt and black pepper and cornstarch. Leave in the fridge for at least  30 minutes. Meanwhile heat up your oil, break two yolks over the chicken and massage it in. Pour the flour mixture over and season with some more salt and black pepper. Really push the dry ingredients into the nooks of the bird. Deep-fry for about 10 minutes till crispy brown. Set aside in a basket to keep it crisp.

Now, in a wok, melt the 2 tablespoons of butter. On medium-high heat, fry the garlic, chili and curry leaves till fragrant. Add in your mashed up salted egg. Things will start to get foamy really fast, that's normal. Lower your heat to a medium-low. Once the yolks has started to cook, add in the evaporated milk and keep stirring to form a smooth sauce. You can add more evaporated milk if you desire more sauce. No one is judging. Toss your fried chicken through the sauce and you're ready.

Oh don't forget the fried egg as well.

Lasagne from the heart
Makes enough for 3

Lasagne sheets

200g flour
2 eggs
Pinch of salt

Do like you do in all the pasta videos you've ever watched in your life. Make a well in your dry ingredients. Break your eggs in the centre. Whisk gently and slowly incorporate your flour in. Slowly work it in till your dough isn't tacky any more. Form a little dough ball, clingfilm and leave it in the fridge for half an hour.

Turn it onto a clean surface and knead for 8-10 minutes till you get a smooth dough. Working in 4 pieces, roll them out thinly with plenty of flour in between till it's thin enough to see your fingers.

String over wooden sticks and leave to dry.

Béchamel

2 Tablespoon of flour
2 tablespoon of butter
400g milk
Black pepper
1/4 cup parmesan cheese

In a skillet, place your flour in and heat up the pan till medium heat. Introduce the butter and combine it with the flour to form a Panada. After about a minute, whisk in the milk little by little. Continue to whisk over medium-low heat till it comes to a slight simmer and a roux is formed. Throw in the Cheese and whisk to combine.
•••••
In a casserole dish, layer your Ragu, then your pasta strip. Followed by cheese, béchamel sauce, another pasta sheet, Ragu, cheese, bechamel and repeat. Finally above the final pasta sheet, layer on the remainder of the meat sauce and all the béchamel. Sprinkle on as much cheese as one can manage.

Put your Lasagne in a pre-heated 180°C oven for 40 minutes under a loose foil tent. Remove the aluminium foil for the last 10 minutes to get a nice browned top.

Avoiding my insipid memories of egg white Omelettes on buffet lines, I set out to achieve some sort of browning. And yes, it's possible.

Egg White Omelette

4 egg whites (Korean #CheonggyewonEgg for the win!)
1 tablespoon parmesan cheese
1/8 TSP Garlic powder
Salt and black pepper
1 small tomato diced
3 stalks coriander, finely chopped
Olive oil

Take your egg whites and whisk it in a bowl with garlic powder and a pinch of sea salt. Put your back into it and whisk for at least 2 minutes till light and frothy and literally no pool of liquid whites exist. It's going to hurt a little especially if you haven't quite warmed up. But it's worth it.

Warm up a skillet with a good glug of olive oil on medium heat. Using a spatula, fold in your parmesan cheese into the egg white mixture. Dice up your tomato and coriander. Set aside.

Once the pan is hot, pour in your egg white mixture. Leave for about 15 seconds before scattering your tomatoes and coriander over. Put a lid on and cook on medium-low for 2 minutes. Season with black pepper. Fold over and flip out onto a plate.

It warrants a vintage floral table cloth laid over the ole’ dining table, hot milk tea in a pot dressed in a wool sleeve to match. There’s the IPA sourdough that heaves and cracks under the serrated knife. You’ll smother that with duck rillette and then continue building your next open-faced sandwich layered with slices of nutty manchego cheese and house-smoked country ham. We suspect the other dishes outside of the deli selection to be equally captivating, but why deviate from whipped lard?

Being plugged to an inhaler since young and having to do frequent night runs to the ER in search of comfort by ventilator, I wasn't privy to the joy juice till a much later age. By then, surrounding by cousins and other kids who would turn to the red can as their choice reward for completing tasks, I had built this infallible impression of the drink. 'It will the best thing I've drank ever,' I psyched myself as I took my first sip at the age 12. **Pause**, nothing, not even the slightest flutter in my tummy. ""That's it?"" - I remember myself saying.

So, turns out my love for the beverage has never run deep and it is the same for most carbonated drinks. Rum and Coke? Would it be rude if I decline? 🤗; That was till I tasted the Coca-Cola chicken at @vascosingapore by @jenniferangelalee. What sorcery. I still think about it from time to time.

1 chili padi
Coriander
1 clove garlic
1 tbsp fish sauce
White pepper
1/2 tbsp cornstarch

Egg, flour and bread crumb for coating
•••••
First of all, place your cold eggs in simmering boiling water for 6 minutes. Immerse those immediately in ice water to stop the cooking process. Proceed to peel after 5 minutes. Set aside.

Mix your mince together with the chopped chili padi and garlic and coriander.  Season with fish sauce and white pepper. Combine well and then incorporate with cornstarch.

Take enough mince to fit over your palm, press it to get an even layer from tip of your fingers to the base of your palm. Place egg in the center of the meat and enrobe the egg, making sure there are no cracks in the ball. Repeat and place both balls in the fridge to set for about half an hour.

Prepare the three baths, first of seasoned flour (just salt and pepper), second of a beaten egg and third of bread crumbs. Meanwhile heat up your oil till about 180°C. Run your 'meatballs' through the three baths and set aside as you wait for the oil to hear up.

Fry for 7 - 8 minutes or till golden brown. Leave on wire rack to cool before slicing through and devouring with Thai sweet sauce.

Scallion Pancake
Ingredients
•
200g flour
170g boiling water
Salt
Scallions (at least 5 full stalks, chopped)
Sesame Oil
Five Spice Powder
Sesame seeds (optional)
•
In a bowl, mix flour, salt and boiling water. Using a pair of chopsticks, mix till you get scraggly lumps of dough. When it's slightly cool, knead it in the bowl for a bit then move the affair to a clean board and knead it for another 10minutes. Roll into a ball and cling film - leaving to rest for 20 minutes.

Chop up your scallions. By right, you're supposed to only use the green bits, but in the day and age, there's no call for wastage. I used the whites too.

Knead again for 5 minutes, you should get a really smooth dough, slightly elastic even. Roll into a tube and cut up in 4 equal pieces.

Using a rolling pin, stretch out the dough till almost paper thin. Brush with sesame oil, sprinkle lightly with five spice powder and salt. Cover liberally in scallions. Roll it up and shape into a snail. Leave it covered for another 20 minutes under a sheet of cling film or dish cloth. Continue with the rest of the three rolls.

Pre-heat your pan with a mix of sesame oil and regular cooking oil on medium heat. Just a light sheen. We're pan-frying, not deep-frying here. On a sesame oiled surface, smash down the snail and roll it out flat. Cook the one side for 3 minutes before flipping it over and cooking for another 2 minutes.

Prepare your dipping sauce : 3 tablespoons soy sauce, 3 tablespoons black vinegar, 1 TSP chili oil and a dash of sugar.

Slice your pancakes into quarters and dig in. Don't be scared of the thunder.

It's a meal for one, upgraded by the pure fact that it begins with a French 🇫🇷 jaune poulet. A Spring chicken weighing at under 400g, it's small yet goes a long way.

Skillet chicken

1 whole chicken
Salt
Black pepper
2 - 3 cloves garlic smashed

So you flip the chick on her front and approach her from the back. Things are not going to get frisky I can assure you. You might need a pair of heavy-duty scissors for this. Snip down the backbone/ remove it completely and push down heavily on the back to spread the bird into a single layer.

From here on out, a couple more snips are required to get as flat a bird as possible. It's physics, more surface area in contact with the pan, more crispy skin!

So, I remove the breastbone as well but left the wing tips on. Becoz love. Fret not, all bones went into a seperate stock which I will showcase another day.

Flip the chicken over with skin side exposed, by now, it should look like you, poolside on a deck chair after a heavy night of a drinking. Lazy and shapeless. Salt and pepper the skin of the chicken liberally and leave it in the fridge to 'dry-out' for at least 2 hours or overnight if you will.

In a cold pan, lay the chicken skin side down. No oil is required. Turn the heat on to a medium-low and leave a lid on. Leave it to render and crispen up for 20 - 25 mins (this varies extensively on the size of your chicken), at the final 5 mins mark, place 2 smashed garlic cloves in the pan with a little knob of butter.

Flip the bird over meat side and cook for another 2 - 3 minutes. Transfer it to a chopping board, leave to rest for a little while before slicing and digging in.

Read on. Things are about to get spicy.

Steak always spark some sort of a debate in our home and amidst all this table feuds, I'm quick to realise one thing. We should never impose our own eating values on to others and similarly, we should never be forced into ordering something a certain way just because others are. i.e. Make informed decisions instead of being influenced.
•
When I was getting down to cooking the steaks, I casually asked in my most jaunty  voice, ""How would prefer your steak done?"" - to which they both replied medium-rare please. So I did accordingly, incredibly chuffed at the visual cues of mauve red innards housed within a solid crust. Mind you, my parents are seasoned steak eaters, I'm sure, but perhaps not in the more refined establishments and also always making the safer options for cuts. They nudged their way around the more rare bits with an obvious distasteful look plastered on their faces. ""It's raw,"" - I flew into a rage (on the inside). ""Look guys, it isn't raw, it's just medium rare, the way you requested,"" I replied callously.  Disgruntled, I proceeded to slap the remaining slices on the pan. Using my tongs to press down with vengeance till the entire slice was cooked through. ""Wah, much better,"" they said accompanied with voluntary thumbs up - *cue Face Palm* 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️
•
Granted my frustration at the situation, I became quick to realise that we should never under any circumstances impose our values on others. I love you guys, but for goodness sakes, if you want it well-done. Just say you wanted it so from the start. 😌 Kthxbye.

80ml evaporated milk, more if you like it saucy
2 cloves garlic, finely minced
2 chili padi, chopped

Steam or boil your salted duck eggs. Boiling should require around 15 minutes. After which seperate the yolks from the whites. Place in a bowl and mash till you get really tiny crumbs.

Marinade your chopped chicken with the rice wine, salt and black pepper and cornstarch. Leave in the fridge for at least  30 minutes. Meanwhile heat up your oil, break two yolks over the chicken and massage it in. Pour the flour mixture over and season with some more salt and black pepper. Really push the dry ingredients into the nooks of the bird. Deep-fry for about 10 minutes till crispy brown. Set aside in a basket to keep it crisp.

Now, in a wok, melt the 2 tablespoons of butter. On medium-high heat, fry the garlic, chili and curry leaves till fragrant. Add in your mashed up salted egg. Things will start to get foamy really fast, that's normal. Lower your heat to a medium-low. Once the yolks has started to cook, add in the evaporated milk and keep stirring to form a smooth sauce. You can add more evaporated milk if you desire more sauce. No one is judging. Toss your fried chicken through the sauce and you're ready.

Oh don't forget the fried egg as well.

Also, you can try your hand at a quick ragu, but I managed to free a box of 4-hour bolognaise sauce from the depths of my freezer for this happy occasion. Recipe ➡️: https://bit.ly/3i3OCjU
•••••
Lasagne from the heart
Makes enough for 3

Lasagne sheets

200g flour
2 eggs
Pinch of salt

Do like you do in all the pasta videos you've ever watched in your life. Make a well in your dry ingredients. Break your eggs in the centre. Whisk gently and slowly incorporate your flour in. Slowly work it in till your dough isn't tacky any more. Form a little dough ball, clingfilm and leave it in the fridge for half an hour.

Turn it onto a clean surface and knead for 8-10 minutes till you get a smooth dough. Working in 4 pieces, roll them out thinly with plenty of flour in between till it's thin enough to see your fingers.

String over wooden sticks and leave to dry.

Béchamel

2 Tablespoon of flour
2 tablespoon of butter
400g milk
Black pepper
1/4 cup parmesan cheese

In a skillet, place your flour in and heat up the pan till medium heat. Introduce the butter and combine it with the flour to form a Panada. After about a minute, whisk in the milk little by little. Continue to whisk over medium-low heat till it comes to a slight simmer and a roux is formed. Throw in the Cheese and whisk to combine.
•••••
In a casserole dish, layer your Ragu, then your pasta strip. Followed by cheese, béchamel sauce, another pasta sheet, Ragu, cheese, bechamel and repeat. Finally above the final pasta sheet, layer on the remainder of the meat sauce and all the béchamel. Sprinkle on as much cheese as one can manage.

Put your Lasagne in a pre-heated 180°C oven for 40 minutes under a loose foil tent. Remove the aluminium foil for the last 10 minutes to get a nice browned top.

Avoiding my insipid memories of egg white Omelettes on buffet lines, I set out to achieve some sort of browning. And yes, it's possible.

Egg White Omelette

4 egg whites (Korean #CheonggyewonEgg for the win!)
1 tablespoon parmesan cheese
1/8 TSP Garlic powder
Salt and black pepper
1 small tomato diced
3 stalks coriander, finely chopped
Olive oil

Take your egg whites and whisk it in a bowl with garlic powder and a pinch of sea salt. Put your back into it and whisk for at least 2 minutes till light and frothy and literally no pool of liquid whites exist. It's going to hurt a little especially if you haven't quite warmed up. But it's worth it.

Warm up a skillet with a good glug of olive oil on medium heat. Using a spatula, fold in your parmesan cheese into the egg white mixture. Dice up your tomato and coriander. Set aside.

Once the pan is hot, pour in your egg white mixture. Leave for about 15 seconds before scattering your tomatoes and coriander over. Put a lid on and cook on medium-low for 2 minutes. Season with black pepper. Fold over and flip out onto a plate.

It warrants a vintage floral table cloth laid over the ole’ dining table, hot milk tea in a pot dressed in a wool sleeve to match. There’s the IPA sourdough that heaves and cracks under the serrated knife. You’ll smother that with duck rillette and then continue building your next open-faced sandwich layered with slices of nutty manchego cheese and house-smoked country ham. We suspect the other dishes outside of the deli selection to be equally captivating, but why deviate from whipped lard?

Being plugged to an inhaler since young and having to do frequent night runs to the ER in search of comfort by ventilator, I wasn't privy to the joy juice till a much later age. By then, surrounding by cousins and other kids who would turn to the red can as their choice reward for completing tasks, I had built this infallible impression of the drink. 'It will the best thing I've drank ever,' I psyched myself as I took my first sip at the age 12. **Pause**, nothing, not even the slightest flutter in my tummy. ""That's it?"" - I remember myself saying.

So, turns out my love for the beverage has never run deep and it is the same for most carbonated drinks. Rum and Coke? Would it be rude if I decline? 🤗; That was till I tasted the Coca-Cola chicken at @vascosingapore by @jenniferangelalee. What sorcery. I still think about it from time to time.

300g pork mince
1 chili padi
Coriander
1 clove garlic
1 tbsp fish sauce
White pepper
1/2 tbsp cornstarch

Egg, flour and bread crumb for coating
•••••
First of all, place your cold eggs in simmering boiling water for 6 minutes. Immerse those immediately in ice water to stop the cooking process. Proceed to peel after 5 minutes. Set aside.

Mix your mince together with the chopped chili padi and garlic and coriander.  Season with fish sauce and white pepper. Combine well and then incorporate with cornstarch.

Take enough mince to fit over your palm, press it to get an even layer from tip of your fingers to the base of your palm. Place egg in the center of the meat and enrobe the egg, making sure there are no cracks in the ball. Repeat and place both balls in the fridge to set for about half an hour.

Prepare the three baths, first of seasoned flour (just salt and pepper), second of a beaten egg and third of bread crumbs. Meanwhile heat up your oil till about 180°C. Run your 'meatballs' through the three baths and set aside as you wait for the oil to hear up.

Fry for 7 - 8 minutes or till golden brown. Leave on wire rack to cool before slicing through and devouring with Thai sweet sauce.

•
Scallion Pancake
Ingredients
•
200g flour
170g boiling water
Salt
Scallions (at least 5 full stalks, chopped)
Sesame Oil
Five Spice Powder
Sesame seeds (optional)
•
In a bowl, mix flour, salt and boiling water. Using a pair of chopsticks, mix till you get scraggly lumps of dough. When it's slightly cool, knead it in the bowl for a bit then move the affair to a clean board and knead it for another 10minutes. Roll into a ball and cling film - leaving to rest for 20 minutes.

Chop up your scallions. By right, you're supposed to only use the green bits, but in the day and age, there's no call for wastage. I used the whites too.

Knead again for 5 minutes, you should get a really smooth dough, slightly elastic even. Roll into a tube and cut up in 4 equal pieces.

Using a rolling pin, stretch out the dough till almost paper thin. Brush with sesame oil, sprinkle lightly with five spice powder and salt. Cover liberally in scallions. Roll it up and shape into a snail. Leave it covered for another 20 minutes under a sheet of cling film or dish cloth. Continue with the rest of the three rolls.

Pre-heat your pan with a mix of sesame oil and regular cooking oil on medium heat. Just a light sheen. We're pan-frying, not deep-frying here. On a sesame oiled surface, smash down the snail and roll it out flat. Cook the one side for 3 minutes before flipping it over and cooking for another 2 minutes.

Prepare your dipping sauce : 3 tablespoons soy sauce, 3 tablespoons black vinegar, 1 TSP chili oil and a dash of sugar.

Slice your pancakes into quarters and dig in. Don't be scared of the thunder.

It's a meal for one, upgraded by the pure fact that it begins with a French 🇫🇷 jaune poulet. A Spring chicken weighing at under 400g, it's small yet goes a long way.

Skillet chicken

1 whole chicken
Salt
Black pepper
2 - 3 cloves garlic smashed

So you flip the chick on her front and approach her from the back. Things are not going to get frisky I can assure you. You might need a pair of heavy-duty scissors for this. Snip down the backbone/ remove it completely and push down heavily on the back to spread the bird into a single layer.

From here on out, a couple more snips are required to get as flat a bird as possible. It's physics, more surface area in contact with the pan, more crispy skin!

So, I remove the breastbone as well but left the wing tips on. Becoz love. Fret not, all bones went into a seperate stock which I will showcase another day.

Flip the chicken over with skin side exposed, by now, it should look like you, poolside on a deck chair after a heavy night of a drinking. Lazy and shapeless. Salt and pepper the skin of the chicken liberally and leave it in the fridge to 'dry-out' for at least 2 hours or overnight if you will.

In a cold pan, lay the chicken skin side down. No oil is required. Turn the heat on to a medium-low and leave a lid on. Leave it to render and crispen up for 20 - 25 mins (this varies extensively on the size of your chicken), at the final 5 mins mark, place 2 smashed garlic cloves in the pan with a little knob of butter.

Flip the bird over meat side and cook for another 2 - 3 minutes. Transfer it to a chopping board, leave to rest for a little while before slicing and digging in.

Read on. Things are about to get spicy.

Steak always spark some sort of a debate in our home and amidst all this table feuds, I'm quick to realise one thing. We should never impose our own eating values on to others and similarly, we should never be forced into ordering something a certain way just because others are. i.e. Make informed decisions instead of being influenced.
•
When I was getting down to cooking the steaks, I casually asked in my most jaunty  voice, ""How would prefer your steak done?"" - to which they both replied medium-rare please. So I did accordingly, incredibly chuffed at the visual cues of mauve red innards housed within a solid crust. Mind you, my parents are seasoned steak eaters, I'm sure, but perhaps not in the more refined establishments and also always making the safer options for cuts. They nudged their way around the more rare bits with an obvious distasteful look plastered on their faces. ""It's raw,"" - I flew into a rage (on the inside). ""Look guys, it isn't raw, it's just medium rare, the way you requested,"" I replied callously.  Disgruntled, I proceeded to slap the remaining slices on the pan. Using my tongs to press down with vengeance till the entire slice was cooked through. ""Wah, much better,"" they said accompanied with voluntary thumbs up - *cue Face Palm* 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️
•
Granted my frustration at the situation, I became quick to realise that we should never under any circumstances impose our values on others. I love you guys, but for goodness sakes, if you want it well-done. Just say you wanted it so from the start. 😌 Kthxbye.

3 eggs
3 tablespoon Chinese rice wine
2 TSP sugar
2 tablespoon soy sauce
5 tablespoon water

Boil a pot of water sufficient enough to fully submerge 3 eggs.

Once on a rolling boil, put in your 3 cold eggs straight from the fridge into the water carefully using a slotted spoon. Lower the heat to a simmer.

Set your timing for exactly 6 1/2 minutes and once that's done, remove the eggs and dunk them into ice cold water to stop the cooking process.

Prepare the marinade in a deep bowl. Making sure to try and dissolve the sugar.

Peel the eggs and soak them in the marinade, making sure to turn them ever so often to allow the flavours to sink in. Leave in the fridge from anywhere between 3 hours to overnight.

20/6/2020,fundamentally_flawed,"Since I've subscribed to Korean #CheonggyewonEgg, there's no turning back. Our daily consumption of eggs coupled with  the fact that these antibiotic-free eggs are incredibly fresh justifying their prime real estate in my fridge. Best part, they are just a hop and a skip away at my neighborhood Cold Storage.

If you're gunning for an 'imitation' {Egg Slut} at home, here's how it goes.

First crack three eggs straight into a cold pan and throw in a big knob of butter. Don't stinge. Stir the eggs and butter together even before turning on the pilot light. ""Almost till it forms like a sauce,"" says Alvin Cailan. Put the pan on medium heat and continue stirring with your spatula to create a velvety texture. Be sure to constantly scrape the bottoms of the pan and fold your eggs over to create loose layers. When the eggs start to bind, remove from the heat. These babies are ready. Sprinkle your chives over and spoon lovingly over your toasted buns.

Liu Sha Bao
Makes enough fillings for 5 buns

2 salted duck eggs steamed
40g butter, melted and cooled
12g icing sugar
4g cornflour
20g milk powder
14ml fresh milk

Steam your duck eggs and squish with a fork. Blend in your butter with a tiny whisk and continue to blend in icing sugar, cornflour and milk powder till a paste. Whisk in fresh milk and making sure there are no lumps. Set aside in the fridge it freezer till set. You'll want to portion out 20g of filling per 40g Dough ball.

Kimchi Pancake
Makes one large pancake

1 small onion, thinly sliced
2/3 cup kimchi, chopped with your handy kitchen scissors (@wealllovekimchi being my chosen subject today for its subtle sour and nutty notes)
A bunch of at least 4 scallions, chopped

Pancake batter
1 cup of flour - 4 tbsp flour (remove from)
1 tbsp cornstarch
1 TSP gochujang
1 tbsp kimchi juice
2/3 cup ice water

Prepare all your ingredients before hand, slicing everything and setting aside.

For the batter, dissolve gochujang and kimchi juice in the water. Give it a good stir, then slowly incorporate it into the dry ingredients, whisking to make sure there are no lumps. Do not overmix.

In a large bowl, mix the two together till everything is evenly spread out.

Warm a skillet with a tablespoon of oil on medium-high heat. once hot enough, pour in all your batter and using a spatula, spread out across the pan to get a flat layer. Cook for at least 4 minutes on one side before attempting to flip. Cook for the same amount of time on that side then flip again. Cook till brown on both sides. Slide it on to a plate as best a you can and serve with dipping sauce (equal parts soy sauce, water and a days of vinegar).

Bonus: it's mighty fun to make for those itching for a little bit of self-worth enhancing, hands-on action in the kitchen.

Kueh Ondeh Ondeh
Makes about 25 - 30

250g glutinous rice flour
1 tbsp brown sugar
250ml water blended with 5 pieces of pandan leaf chopped up
1 tbsp oil

100 gula melaka

150g grated coconut
Pinch of salt

Go ahead and steam your grated coconut combined with the salt for about 10 minutes. Remove and let cool.

Meantime make your dough by blending water together with the pandan leaves and putting that through a fine sieve. Making sure to press out all the pandan juice. Heat that in a pot till almost simmering.

Combine your glutinous rice flour and brown sugar. Making a well in the middle. Pour in the warm pandan juice and work it using chopsticks to form a paste. As larger crumbs start to form, pour in the oil and continue to work it till it's cool enough to maneuver with your fingers. Knead the dough till smooth and less sticky to the touch. Rest the dough underneath a damp towel.

Go ahead and chop your gula melaka into  tiny chunks. Set aside and please resist the urge to snack.

Measure out 13 - 15g pieces of dough. Roll into a ball and using your thumb, press out an indentation in the center which you'll then fill with gula melaka. Pinch the seams to seal the sugar in and roll out again into a  smooth ball.

By this time, you should have a pot of water on a rolling boil ready. Plop your balls into the water and leave them in there till they start to float (6 - 7 mins) and using a sieve, rescue them and roll them around in the bowl of steamed coconut you had set aside just now.

One of new-found favourite ways to consume your morning dose of posh roe is on crisp rösti dollop with crème fraîche. Enjoy with a mimosa, or a coffee (if you're the hoi polloi like me) with your pinkie up, because you are fancy now.

Rösti for one

1 large russet potato
1 Tablespoon of ghee
Salt, pepper, cayenne pepper
Creme fraîche
Caviar (@caviarcolony Amur for a touch of nuttiness)

Par-boil your potato in slightly salted waters for a good 12 minutes. Fish out and set aside on a plate in the fridge.

Forget about it for at least 2 hours.

Grate the potato coarsely and salt it immediately. After about 10 minutes or so, drain out the water, lightly squeeze the potato strips to rid of excess moisture - this will ensure a crisper rösti. Toss with cayenne pepper and ground black pepper. Heat your mini pan up with a little ghee (butter is fine too) until sizzling. Stack your grated potatoes in the pan and press down lightly to squash the sides for as flat a surface as possible.

Cook for a couple of minutes then gently free the sides. Drizzle a little ghee on the top surface. After about 8 minutes. Invert the pan on to a plate and then slide that back into the pan to cook the other side. Continue to cook for another 8 minutes till nice and crispy.

Wait at least 5 minutes for the rösti to cool before topping with your creme fraîche and caviar. Devour with panache.

1 tbsp kecap Manis (If you prefer the dark carrot cake version)
1 TSP oyster sauce
1 TSP light soy sauce (both not needed in the case of using above mentioned yam cake, but if you're using a generic brand, seasoning is required)
Sesame oil

First in a wok with a little bit of oil, fry up the garlic till fragrant then add in the cubed yam cake and bump up the heat to high. Add the seasoning in (if required) and then allow the cake to crispen evenly. Make a little space for the eggs, you might want to add a little bit more oil and then allow the eggs to semi set first before scrambling it with the yam cake. Add in your chopped scallions and give a couple of tosses.

Coq au vin blanc or Chicken in creamy white wine sauce
Makes enough for 3 - 4

600g boneless chicken thigh
3 garlic cloves
4 rashes of bacon, sliced
1 brown onion, finely sliced
1 cup dry white wine
250g oyster mushroom, sliced
1/4 cup pork stock
Sprinkle of dry sage
Black pepper
100ml crème fraîche

Finely chopped parsley (I used Korean perilla leaf)

Preheat your oven to 180°C. You'll want to be working in a cast iron skillet that's oven safe. If not, I would suggest cooking in a skillet and then transferring everything to a casserole dish.

Heat a little olive oil in a skillet. Fry your bacon till slightly crisp. Set aside. In the same pan, brown off your chicken, skin side down until golden brown. Turn to the other side and cook for 1 minutes. Remove from pan and set aside in the casserole dish.

In the same pan, reduce heat to a medium, melt a knob of butter an soften your onions. Add in the garlic and fry till fragrant. Then toss in the oyster mushrooms and bacon. After about a minute, deglaze the skillet with white wine, making sure to scrap the bottom of the skillet for the desirable brown bits. Add stock and bring to a simmer. Season with dried sage and black pepper.

Pour over the arranged browned chicken thighs. Making sure to arrange the chicken skin side up on the surface of the dish.

Put the lid on and bake for 45 minutes with lid one. Bake for another 10 - 15 minutes with the lid off to achieve crispy brown skin.

Move the chicken to the side of the dish, incorporate crème fraîche by stirring it in to get a creamy sauce. YAS.

Serve with fresh bread, pasta or cheesy mashed potatoes. Either way, trust that you'll have no regrets.

Sure, round up a Balvenie Old Fashioned as your cheerleader and chug through that 15 - 20mins of prep time tonight. Trust me, the overwhelming response of warmth you'll receive after the second proof makes everything worth it.

And if you've missed the recipe the first time, here goes.

Chocolate Babka
makes 3 mini loaves

350g all purpose flour
67g sugar
7g dry yeast
2 eggs
80g lukewarm water
1/2 TSP salt
100g butter, cubed

200g gianduja paste or Nutella
60g chocolate, chopped

In a stand-mixer with a dough hook, combine the flour, sugar and yeast. Add in the eggs and the water and mix to form a dough. Once it starts to come together, sprinkle in the salt and start to feed the dough, cubes of butter, little by little. Keep the machine going for 10 mins or till the dough starts to peel away from the sides.

Put the dough in a lightly oiled bowl and cling-wrap the top to ensure it's air tight. Leave in the fridge overnight or for at least 8 hours. This will help with the ease of rolling out in the morning.

Divide the dough into 3. Roll each one to about 7.5 x 6 inches. Spread chocolate all over, leaving about an inch gap at the end. Scatter chopped chocolate. Roll it up to form a log. With the seamed side down, use a knife and slice it right through the center. Squish down one end and then work the two logs into a simple 2-ply plait with the chocolatey innards showing outwards. Fold and shape the braid and fit it in those buttered up loaf tins. You can refer to my drawings ➡️ if you like.

Leave to proof in a warm place for 45 mins. Take the time to whisper sweet nothing to them, they like that. Bake in a 190°C oven for 26 minutes. Take them out and brush over a simple syrup. Cool and conquer.

Much needed, after some jittery swells from good news received from the Frenchie about borders being opened on the 1st July in the wee hours of the morning. These news however plagued with uncertainty in the specifics.

Cracking open 3 eggs, I beat them with my indispensable tiny beater with a pinch of sea salt until bubbles form on top. Then I leave this weaves of whites and yellows to mingle for 15 minutes on the counter top (top tip for tender eggs as salt dissolves the proteins and assists in creating a tighter moisture-binding network) as I get on with the morning coffee. Heating up the pan, I add in a dash of milk and a chunk of butter to the eggs. I then cook the eggs over a low flame, stirring constantly. The result is a cascade of fluff, soft on the verge of custardy scrambled eggs.

Kimchi Tagliatelle
Makes enough to feed 2 peckish eaters

120g dried tagliatelle
1/3 cup kimchi (@wealllovekimchi)
1 clove garlic, minced
6 TSP kimchi juice
1 TSP gochujang or doubanjiang
1 knob of butter
4 strips of bacon
A handful of shredded Edam cheese/ cheddar cheese
Scallions sliced on a diagonal

Slice your bacon into tiny slices and set aside. In a bowl and using a pair of nifty scissors, slice the kimchi into tiny slices; in the Korean kitchen, it's an indispensable tool ✂️. Mince your garlic. Prepare your sauce, in a seperate bowl, combine the kimchi juice and TSP of gochujang together.

Cook your tagliatelle or your choice of pasta about 2 minutes less than the package recommends. I cooked mine for 6.5 mins. When you're into 2 minutes of the cook, heat up a skillet with olive oil, fry bacon for about 2 minutes, add in the Garlic and fry it till slightly brown. Now add in the chopped kimchi and keep stirring.

Once the pasta is ready, drain it and reserve some of the pasta water. Introduce your kimchi juice sauce and about 1/4 cup of pasta water into the pan. Toss in the pasta. Add in a healthy knob of butter to loosen the mixture. Add in cheese if it's at your disposal (I like that subtle inflections of foreign influence here) then with the flame switched off, toss to emulsify and dish out piping hot.

Garnish with spring onions and a #CheonggyewonEgg fried egg.

Unlike a year ago when over-the-top monsta creations were invading front pages, now there's a new vogue for value-for-money yet quality online purchases. And so far, Wildfire is at the top of their game.

A mindful mixing of flavours from char to sweetness of caramelised onions and heat from chipotle mayo deny the necessity for volume by double meat patties. That also ensures the burgers transport well. I don't have to twist your arm to tell you to order the Shabu Burger - black Angus beef shabu cooked in yakiniku sauce, shimeiji mushrooms and goma sauce. It reads like a dream and taste like a gyūdon had put on a spanking brand new suit. Both the @snakeriverfarms wagyu burger and Shabu burger are priced at $13 whilst the eggstarter (a glorious take on the bacon egg roll) is just $9.

A therapy, or affordable luxury that you just might need occasionally during these times.

To say that these are the best I've ever had, would be grossly patronising, but to have the liberty to top it with whatever pleases you, now that deserves the accompaniment of some champagne. Today's crowning glory courtesy of @caviarcolony.
•••
Siu Mai
Makes 20

Egg wanton wrappers (get the round ones, I struggled a little with the edges of the square)
120g prawns, de-shelled
280g pork mince, the fattier the better
1 TSP soy sauce
1 tbsp Chinese rice wine
1/2 TSP salt
2 TSP sugar
3 scallion stalks, just the base, finely minced
3 dried shiitake mushrooms

Garnish: XO sauce + Caviar if you're feeling like a baller.

Soak your dried mushrooms in hot water for 20 mins. De-stem and slice the caps into tiny pieces.

Mix the pork mince with soy sauce, Chinese rice wine, salt and sugar in a bowl. Using your fingers and rotating in a single direction till it starts to form a paste. Chop your prawns into 1/2 cm pieces, toss that in with the minced pork, chopped scallions and mushrooms. It's a party. Combine.

Prepare your perforated wax paper by cutting holes in non-stick baking paper and mounting it into the bamboo steaming baskets. Heat up water in your wok till it's at a rolling boil.

Start filling your egg wrappers. You'll want to use your thumb and index finger to form an 'o' then using your middle finger as a base, push the meat mixture into the 'o', filling up the base edges to get an even package. It take practise but you'll eventually get the hang of it. 
Top the dumplings with a little bit of XO sauce (optional) at this point. You can also top with chopped carrot or peas for colour. Put the lid on and steam for 7 - 8 minutes.

Top with @caviarcolony Amur caviar, pop those piping-hot parcels into your mouth instantly. Regret a little, hang your mouth open and commence eating with a 'humph'. So good.

Luckily I've got a few tricks up my sleeves when it comes to dealing with salmon fillets. Quick and easy, the end product is still a show-off.

Creamy Salmon Pasta
Makes enough for 3

250g salmon fillet, skin-on (we got ours from @superseafoodsg)
2 cloves garlic finely chopped
1/2 onion, sliced thinly
1/2 cup milk
Big knob of butter
200g dried pasta
1 TSP lemon juice

Peas, spinach, optional

Sear your salmon fillet, skin side down first. Salt the fillet and cook for about 4 minutes on each side. Set aside.

While the salmon is cooking, boil your pasta in salted waters for 7 - 8 minutes. Drain and reserve a bit of the pasta water for later.

Heat up some a splash of olive oil in a sauce pan. Sauté your onion till soft and then add in the garlic and fry till slightly brown. Pour in your milk and slide in the knob of butter. Emulsify with 2 tablespoon of pasta water, the present thickeners in the pasta water forming some sterling relationships with whatever hot fat hanging out in your pan. Let simmer a little while. Add in the pasta and toss to coat. Reintroduce your salmon, breaking it into smaller pieces and mixing it through the pasta. Season to taste and serve hot.

Designed to appeal to the little munchkins who love to pick out the crust on their grilled cheese sandwiches - even the adults will want in on these.

Grilled cheese roll-ups

2 regular slices of loaf bread (this recipe doesn't discriminate against sunshine or gardenia 🤟)
Cheese slices (I see thinly sliced Greek  Graviera cheese from @classicdelisg, but you can use gruyère, Colby, muenster, etc)
Butter and olive oil

Using a small rolling pin, roll out the bread slices. Really flattening them out. Trim out the edges using a knife. Roll the cheese within the slices and form tight scrolls.

Warm your pan to medium heat with some butter and olive oil. Place both your scrolls in the pan and slowly start to crispen them up. Rotating them slowly so that they achieve even browning.

Slice into tiny bites and serve. I would a nice Passata alongside this for dipping but they are plenty good on its own.

So when I received my order of Korean flower clams from @superseafoodsg, I instinctively turned to my fridge for inspiration. Sure I would have love to do a stir-fry with doubanjiang and garlic, unfortunately I was not about to adopt another bottle with little real estate to spare. So here's one recipe that I created on the fly and I could tell it hit the spot - just based on the fact that my dad was dredging vegetables through that sauce at the final leg.

Miso stir-fry clam
Makes enough for 3

500g clams
3 cloves garlic minced
2 chili padi, sliced thinly
4 stalks of scallions cut into 3 inch lengths
1 cm of ginger, cut into thin slices

1 tbsp white miso
1 tbsp Chinese rice wine
1/2 TSP sugar
1 TSP tahini - courtesy of @mathieumusnier
2 tbsp water

Mix up the sauce first in a bowl. Set aside.

In a wok with some oil. Toss in the ginger slices and fry till fragrant. The garlic goes in next and on medium high heat, fry till almost brown before adding in the chili padi. There will be lots of choking at this point but stay strong. Add in your clams at this point and the sauce that you've set aside. Toss gently to make sure all the clams are coated before putting a lid on and steaming for about a minute or so till most of the clams have opened up.

Remove the lid. Throw in the spring onion and toss through. Once the sauce has thickened slightly, plate up.

Give your sauce a stir. Set aside.

Whisk flour, salt and cornstarch together. Whisk in the water a little at a time, making sure there are no lumps. Chop your scallions into the mix using a pair of scissors. Heat up your pan with some sesame oil on medium heat. Whisk your egg in another bowl and set aside.

Pour in all your batter at one shot and attempt to spread it out evenly by giving the pan a playful swirl. Cook for half a minute until the pancake looks half cooked. Pour over the egg mixture.

At this point, you're free to throw in cheese, tuna flakes and whatever you please into the mix. Go crazy.

Continue cooking till the egg looks set and the with the aid of a spatula and perhaps a pair of chopsticks, start to roll the pancake.

Add a little more sesame oil to the pan. Turn up the heat and try to crispen the rolled up pancakes on both sides. Be sure not to overcook as the result can be quite tough if the egg scroll over stays its welcome on the pan.

Salty, sweet, spicy and just a tad tangy from the sauces smothered over. It can be tossed together much earlier in the game, the blank canvas of chicken breast providing the perfect platform for the 怪味 ""strange flavour"" sauce to shine. Its name is derived from the sound of the rolling pin bearing down as it flattens the poached chicken and paving the way for easy shredding. Alternatively you can do it the good old fashioned way, with your finger tips if you're not one to favour the ruckus.

1 tablespoon sugar
1 tablespoon sesame oil
2 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds
1 TSP Sichuan peppercorns, grounded
1/2 TSP salt
2 scallions, chopped

Poach your chicken as instructed above. Shred or bang bang if you prefer.

Lay your julienned cucumber on the bottom of the dish followes by the chicken shreds. Prepare the sauce in a small pot, chicken stock, sugar, sauces, sesame oil, seeds and scallions. It's gonna look like a mad tasty party already.

Pour over the chicken and cucumber. Toss to coat when you're ready to eat. Rice or cold noodles, it's all very complimentary and also perfect for the sweltering weather.

8/6/2020,fundamentally_flawed,"While attempting to empty the fridge yesterday, I conceived an anything-but-the-kitchen-sink Swiss roll. It's a scratchy list of things that tried to make their debut on there: salted caramel, butterscotch sauce, lingonberry jam and gianduja spread - bits and bobs from deliveries past. Whatever it is, the red carpet of spreads turned out glorious. Hip hip hooray!

Easy-peasy Swiss roll
Requires one 13 X 9 inch pan

70g plain flour
13g cornstarch
1/4 TSP baking powder
3 large eggs (I used the awesome #CheonggyewonEgg ones) - seperated
80g caster sugar
2.5 tablespoon vegetable oil
2 tablespoon milk

Filling - raid your fridge

Preheat your oven to 180°C. Line a rectangle pan 9 X 13 inch with baking paper. Let the sides stick out.

Sift the flour, cornstarch and baking powder into a bowl.

In your mixing bowl, whisk yolks, oil and milk with 40g caster sugar till light and fluffy. It will take about 6 minutes on the highest speed to achieve pale yellow state.

Fold in the flour mixture gently till there are no visible lumps.

Using a clean bowl, whisk the whites and 40g of sugar till stiff peaks.

Fold in the whites into the yolk mixture in 3 parts. Gently please. It is okay to see streaks of whites at this point. Continue till you get a homogeneous mix. Light and airy

Spread it out on your lined baking pan, making sure it's as even as you possible master (we're not perfect). Give it a light tap on a flat surface to expel the large bubbles. Place the tray on a larger tray with a cup of water poured in and bake that for 15 minutes.

Remove the cake from the oven once 15 minutes is over. Pry at the overhangs and flip out on to a new baking paper almost immediately. Slice off the edges. Spread whatever you want on the underside and proceed to roll up tightly with the aid of the baking paper. Allow to cool in its wrapped state for 15 minutes before slicing and eating.

7/6/2020,fundamentally_flawed,"Seven o'clock this morning with blurry eyes, I toasted slices of altamura bread splashed with extra virgin olive oil on a warm griddle pan. My gentle suggestion of eggs on toast met with luke warm responses at first, but by seven-thirty, all that greet me are yolk stained skid marks on white ceramic plates. I chased this with a bonus toast enlivened with nutella. Who says you can't have dessert at breakfast too?

Bread has always been my carb ride or die and I'm blessed throughout this circuit breaker to traverse the doughy realms from ultra soft milk buns (@sulyntan) to chewy bagels (@breadyard) . @Braci.sg's traditional Altamura bread is a Italian classic from the Puglia region with a PDO status (products with protected designation of origin) - a humble 4 ingredient bread; It is highly intolerant of poor handling. The dark crusted beauty that emerged from Braci's oven is a notch above the rest, though I admit my inexperience may have swayed my opinion. Nutty from the chew and just porous enough to smuggle oil and other delicious sauces.

Top tips: if you've got loaves you can't quite finish fast enough. Slice them immediately and freeze. Their shelf lives improve dramatically, at least 3 months, me thinks or till your carb monsters claim their last victim.

6/6/2020,fundamentally_flawed,"When it comes to my father's favourite afternoon snackages, it's easy to zero in on the big three: bubur cha cha, ondeh ondeh and Kueh salat. Notice the similarities? 🌴 // So this afternoon, away from prying eyes, I set my sights on making these elusive treats (which I now know better to purchase instead). The aftermath was all but empty plates and little grunts of gluttony that ensued. Worth it getting green dough underneath your finger nails? Yes. You might want to solicit some help though.

Kueh Ondeh Ondeh
Makes about 25 - 30

250g glutinous rice flour
1 tbsp brown sugar
250ml water blended with 5 pieces of pandan leaf chopped up
1 tbsp oil

100 gula melaka

150g grated coconut
Pinch of salt

Go ahead and steam your grated coconut combined with the salt for about 10 minutes. Remove and let cool.

Meantime make your dough by blending water together with the pandan leaves and putting that through a fine sieve. Making sure to press out all the pandan juice. Heat that in a pot till almost simmering.

Combine your glutinous rice flour and brown sugar. Making a well in the middle. Pour in the warm pandan juice and work it using chopsticks to form a paste. As larger crumbs start to form, pour in the oil and continue to work it till it's cool enough to maneuver with your fingers. Knead the dough till smooth and less sticky to the touch. Rest the dough underneath a damp towel.

Go ahead and chop your gula melaka into  tiny chunks. Set aside and please resist the urge to snack.

Measure out 13 - 15g pieces of dough. Roll into a ball and using your thumb, press out an indentation in the center which you'll then fill with gula melaka. Pinch the seams to seal the sugar in and roll out again into a  smooth ball.

By this time, you should have a pot of water on a rolling boil ready. Plop your balls into the water and leave them in there till they start to float (6 - 7 mins) and using a sieve, rescue them and roll them around in the bowl of steamed coconut you had set aside just now.

2 tablespoon mayonnaise

Shred up your veggies. Feel free to mix red cabbage and white. Combine it with the the apple cider vinegar, black pepper, olive oil and Dijon mustard. Use your hands to really incorporate it in. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Also add your mayonnaise and toss to combine.

I like to prepare my coleslaw an hour prior to assembling the burgers, leaving it in the fridge till ready to use. That way the flavours really get to know each other.

You'll want to dissect the slice in layers. The mascarpone and chocolate cake layers delivering starkingly different 'feels', from light and spongy towards the top to a more serious, spiked rendition at the bottom. It's a sizable round of soft cake garnished with crispy filo and cocoa nib lace that disappears outrageously quickly.

5/6/2020,fundamentally_flawed,"Bok! Bok! Bitches! Satisfying my fried chicken cravings this afternoon with what  seems like a party platter for 2 of {Salted Egg Chicken}, all to myself. It's one of those things that I've caught on @timtimtokyo 's insanely delicious story feed that has been bugging me for ages. Well, I think those salted duck eggs have served their time on my kitchen counter. Today is the day.

Salted Egg Chicken
Makes enough for 2

400g of chicken thigh, boneless, cut into chunks
2 salted duck eggs
1 cup rice flour
2 tablespoon flour
1 Tablespoon rice wine
Salt & pepper
2 tablespoon cornstarch
2 egg yolks

2 tablespoon butter
Handful of curry leaves
80ml evaporated milk, more if you like it saucy
2 cloves garlic, finely minced
2 chili padi, chopped

Steam or boil your salted duck eggs. Boiling should require around 15 minutes. After which seperate the yolks from the whites. Place in a bowl and mash till you get really tiny crumbs.

Marinade your chopped chicken with the rice wine, salt and black pepper and cornstarch. Leave in the fridge for at least  30 minutes. Meanwhile heat up your oil, break two yolks over the chicken and massage it in. Pour the flour mixture over and season with some more salt and black pepper. Really push the dry ingredients into the nooks of the bird. Deep-fry for about 10 minutes till crispy brown. Set aside in a basket to keep it crisp.

Now, in a wok, melt the 2 tablespoons of butter. On medium-high heat, fry the garlic, chili and curry leaves till fragrant. Add in your mashed up salted egg. Things will start to get foamy really fast, that's normal. Lower your heat to a medium-low. Once the yolks has started to cook, add in the evaporated milk and keep stirring to form a smooth sauce. You can add more evaporated milk if you desire more sauce. No one is judging. Toss your fried chicken through the sauce and you're ready.

Oh don't forget the fried egg as well.

5/6/2020,fundamentally_flawed,"Okay, let's talk buns. These pillowy ones start off with tangzhong starter, or a water roux starter. It's the byword nowadays for bread bakers aspiring towards elevated bread rolls and tender cinnamon buns. // Here's how a little bit of cooked starch makes a difference: By pre-cooking a % of the flour and liquid together, it pre-gelatinizes the starches in the flour meaning that the dough can absorb more water. With more water absorbed, the overall dough is less sticky and hence easier to work with. You could work more liquids into the dough - high hydration therefore equating to moister rolls that will stay fresh for longer.

Without further ado,

Perfect Burger Buns
Makes 8
Recipe from @domestic_gothess

Tangzhong:
20g bread flour
100ml water

Dough:
350g bread flour
7g dry yeast
1 TSP salt
50g caster sugar
1 tbsp milk powder (optional)
125ml milk
1 large egg
50g softened butter

Make the tangzhong first. In a small saucepan, combine the two ingredients and whisk over a medium flame till you get a paste consistency. Set aside to cool.

Place the flour, yeast, salt, sugar and milk powder in a mixing bowl. Whisk together. Fit your stand mixer with a dough hook and make a well in the center of your dry ingredients, add in the egg, milk and tangzhong. Mix until a dough is form. Making sure to scrap the bowl every now and then. Bit by bit, incorporate the softened butter bits. Keep mixing for at least 15 minutes. Scraping down constantly. You'll achieve a tender dough that peels away from the sides.

Transfer the dough to a lightly greased bowl and cling-film the top. Leave to rise until double in size. It will take about 1 hour in S'pore's weather.

Divide the dough into 8 pieces, ~ 90g/piece. Shape each dough to get a smooth ball. Spread them out across your lined baking tray. Leave to rise in a draft-free place for 1 hour. I recommend putting it in the oven and accompanying with a bowl of freshly boiled water for some steamy boosters.

Preheat the oven to 200°C (do make sure to remove your buns first). Egg wash them with beaten egg and milk before sprinkling on some sesame seeds.

Bake for 20 minutes.

First crack three eggs straight into a cold pan and throw in a big knob of butter. Don't stinge. Stir the eggs and butter together even before turning on the pilot light. ""Almost till it forms like a sauce,"" says Alvin Cailan. Put the pan on medium heat and continue stirring with your spatula to create a velvety texture. Be sure to constantly scrape the bottoms of the pan and fold your eggs over to create loose layers. When the eggs start to bind, remove from the heat. These babies are ready.

110g butter, melted and cooled to room temperature
1/2 cup dark brown sugar
1/2 cup plain yogurt
2 large eggs, beaten
1 TSP vanilla extract

Heat your oven to 190°C. Slice the bananas and proceed to mash them up to a pulp.

1/6/2020,fundamentally_flawed,"My hunger to experience nature's spring to summer runway collection has manifested in something green (with envy). 💚 Pandan Soft Milk Buns, the quintessential spring palette, and incredibly goregous to photograph too.

The recipe is up on @sulyntan 's profile and her recent #SoftMilkBunsClub movement has taken on a life of its own with netizen's scuttling in all directions, savoury with cheese and herbs, Milo chocolate filled buns and burger buns?!? It's a circus in there.

I followed the recipe to the tee except for the blending of 10 stalks of pandan leaves with the milk and sieving through for natural pandan flavoured milk. And stuffing each 54g of dough (made 9 buns instead of 16 which I baked in an 8"" square tin) with 6g of Hainanese kaya. Second proofing was done in the cold depths of the fridge as I needed sleep and the thought of fresh bread in the morning was too alluring. Take it out of the fridge first thing in the morning and leave in a warm and draft-free place for about 40 minutes. Glaze with 1-egg + drizzle of milk 'egg-wash' and whack it in the 150°C oven. Would have done 50% coconut milk instead of milk but didn't have any to spare. All the more reason to revisit this recipe!

The 4.3km by 1.8km island enjoys a ultra mild micro-climate that draws in the tourists all year round. Once a major center of albacore tuna fishing, the island still boasts the livelihood of many skilled fishermen.

But keep it to yourself -let others think you toiled for hours over this.

鸡丝虾河粉
Ingredients for 5

Broth
18 prawns - de-shelled, you just need the shell
Rock sugar
1 litre fish bone stock

15 IQF Frozen Tiger Prawns (from @tastegourmetmarket, use promo-code [SIHAN] to enjoy 5% off you entire cart)
Poached and Shredded chicken
Fried shallots
Greens
Sui Kow
Ipoh Hor Fun

Peel the prawns and reserve for dumpling-making. Fry the prawn heads and shells in oil till they turn red in colour. Add water and chicken parts and ikan bilis or prepared fish-bone stock. Simmer for at least an hour.

Strain the soup and transfer to a small pot.

Boil water in a wok and get ready a strainer. First put in your dumplings, these take a while to cook and don't do them in too large a batch to prevent them from sticking to one another. Blanch your Ipoh Hor Fun and leafy greens. Plate them up together with some shredded chicken (poached for 6 minutes in simmering broth/water and then switch off the heat and leave to continue cooking for another 15 mins) Cook your prawns in the boiling water for less than a minute.

Finally drench the hor fun with a few ladles of prawn broth and garnish the dish with fried shallots.

Tips: You'll want to lay the burrata on a paper towel first to soak up the extra water. Tear open your needed piece of Burrata to reveal the creamy innards before laying on the bread. Layer on some sliced cherry tomatoes and dried herbs. Then slap on some more burrata for good times. Making sure to season with pepper and salt along the way.

30/5/2020,fundamentally_flawed,"Fitted in some extra kitchen time this afternoon after tackling lunch to roll out these Kueh Dadar. Took a little motivation but I rolled up my sleeves and got to work on these green scrolls in the end. Ah yes, green 💚, you don't see a lot of that on my feed. That's because nothing really photogenic comes out of it. Wait, actually scratch that: avocado on toast, matcha molten lava cake, green curry. Too soon to speak.

Back to the Kueh Dadar, these are self-indulgent affairs, worthy of brewing that most expensive pot of Oolong tea to accompany it with.

Kueh Dadar
Makes 8 rolls

200g plain flour
15 pandan leaves + 160ml water
200ml coconut milk (thick)
50ml water
1 egg
1 TSP oil
Pinch of salt

120g gula melaka
50ml water
5 pandan leaves knotted together
300g freshly grated coconut

Prepare the filling first. In a pot, place gula melaka, water and the knotted pandan leaves together. Heat up till the sugar completely dissolves and bubbles slightly. Pop in your grated coconut and stir to ensure that all the sugar syrup is absorbed and it is uniformly coloured a caramel brown. Set aside in a warm place.

Prepare the batter. Blitz the snipped up pandan leaves and water together till you get a slurry. Sieve that through a fine mesh sieve, making sure to press out all the remaining pandan juices. Combine the pandan juice with flour, salt, coconut milk, water, egg, oil and salt in a deep bowl. Whisk together to get a nice smooth green batter.

Heat up your pan. I used an 8 inch based pan. Dab the bottom thoroughly with oil. When the pan is about medium heat, pour in a ladle of batter and swirl slightly to get an even layer. Cook for about 2 minutes on one side before flipping over and finishing for another minute on the other.

Set on a wooden board, fill it nicely with just the right amount of coconut filling, and roll up nice and tight. Serve warm.

They currently have a crab promo. 3x500g crabs cooked in any style for $49.90 which is about the price that I pay for crabs at the market! I tried several flavours and I like their black pepper the best. The crabs are quite solid. They are also having a promo on their whole seabass at $12.90 per fish. I also liked their beef hor fun which has the requisite wok hei. Their signature is their lala beehoon which has the sweetness of clam jus in it. It could have been better if the beehoon was more charred. Overall it was a very good meal!

9/6/2020,ieatishootipost,"My Pau quest continues! Today’s Pau come from Mdm Ling Bakery http://bit.ly/ieatMdmLing which is another place recommended by our readers. Those of you who love Tau Sar Pau would immediately recognize this style of Tau Sar Pau made famous by Forty Hands. Since they were introduced years back, these paus have been popping up in Singapore in various places. They are actually imported from JB and they are recognized by their distinctive flat disc shape and smooth tau sar. At 6 for $7.90, they actually cost more than our local variety but no one is complaining as they are less than half the price of the ones sold at the cafe!

I think they are nice but to be honest, these paus have never really blown me away. However, the skin is light and fluffy and their 8 hr slow cooked, de-hulled tau sar is smooth and not too sweet. I have always been prejudiced by their factory made look, but they do stand out as a tau sar pau which is easily recognizable. Sadly, our local tau sar pau are all pretty generic except for perhaps the ones at Joo Huat  http://bit.ly/ieatJooHuatPau who still make their own tau sar. Their Liu Sar paus are also quite nice, albeit also looking very factory made. The salted egg custard is runny and quite nice. 
They are available online and Mdm Ling Bakery also import cookies from Malaysia which you might like to check out at their website.

The buah keluak was already soaked and cracked opened! It really saved me the effort of going down to Tekka market a week ahead to buy and soak the buah keluak and then cracking them open one at a time. The sambal was already made and the lemongrass and shallots are sliced and portioned exactly! Even the chicken was already chopped to the right size! All I needed to do was the final step of putting everything together! 
All three dishes were well proportioned and the ingredients were good quality. I didn’t need to add anything else except a little sugar to balance out the sourness of the Assam and all three dishes were delicious!

Their food is very good quality and they still go to buy the seafood from Jurong fishery port themselves 3 times a week to ensure freshness and quality.  They currently have a crab promo. 3x500g crabs cooked in any style for $49.90 which is about the price that I pay for crabs at the market! I tried several flavours and I like their black pepper the best. The crabs are quite solid. They are also having a promo on their whole seabass at $12.90 per fish. I also liked their beef hor fun which has the requisite wok hei. Their signature is their lala beehoon which has the sweetness of clam jus in it. It could have been better if the beehoon was more charred. Overall it was a very good meal!

9/6/2020,ieatishootipost,"My Pau quest continues! Today’s Pau come from Mdm Ling Bakery http://bit.ly/ieatMdmLing which is another place recommended by our readers. Those of you who love Tau Sar Pau would immediately recognize this style of Tau Sar Pau made famous by Forty Hands. Since they were introduced years back, these paus have been popping up in Singapore in various places. They are actually imported from JB and they are recognized by their distinctive flat disc shape and smooth tau sar. At 6 for $7.90, they actually cost more than our local variety but no one is complaining as they are less than half the price of the ones sold at the cafe!

I think they are nice but to be honest, these paus have never really blown me away. However, the skin is light and fluffy and their 8 hr slow cooked, de-hulled tau sar is smooth and not too sweet. I have always been prejudiced by their factory made look, but they do stand out as a tau sar pau which is easily recognizable. Sadly, our local tau sar pau are all pretty generic except for perhaps the ones at Joo Huat  http://bit.ly/ieatJooHuatPau who still make their own tau sar. Their Liu Sar paus are also quite nice, albeit also looking very factory made. The salted egg custard is runny and quite nice. 
They are available online and Mdm Ling Bakery also import cookies from Malaysia which you might like to check out at their website.

3/6/2020,ieatishootipost,"Had an amazing lunch today from Michelin Star Chef Han Li Guang of Labyrinth. They have just launched Miss Vanda which is their online platform for their takeaway menu. The food is prepared at their kitchen at Labyrinth by the same culinary team.  The two outstanding dishes today were the Wagyu Rendang Buah Keluak which uses Wagyu intercostals braised till fork tender and cooked in a mild rendang gravy and bua keluak purée. It is the best thing that has been delivered to our doorstep since CB started. Their laksa is also really good. Definitely a notch above the hawker version. It’s chock full of seafood like prawns, scallop dumplings  and mussels and the gravy is full of dried prawns, aromatic rempah, laksa leaves and freshly squeezed coconut. The har cheong gai would have been excellent fresh but they were already soft when they arrived, but the surprise was that they have been deboned, so it was really easy to eat. The chicken rice was the only dish I felt ambivalent about. Don’t compare it with the local version as it is supposed to be a claypot “ANG MOH” version that his grandma used to make which comes with a creamy mushroom sauce that tasted a bit like Chicken Ala King. 
Overall, the quality of the food is very good. The team are doing a great job making ultimate versions of our local dishes. Yes, they are more expensive than the hawker version but it wouldn’t be fair to compare their pricing with the hawkers. Instead, you should compare the laksa with a plate of pasta then you will be able to see it’s true value!

Despite being an amputee and having gone through bypass surgery, he still goes to the stall daily to cook. The tender steamed chicken comes dressed with sesame oil, and goes well with its bowl of chicken rice. Beyond that, the chilli sauce also packs a tangy punch. No doubt, this is the thing that makes the chicken rice meal. ⁣

Anything with their signature Thai chilli sauce is a must-order. We had the Thai tofu and Thai style gizzard. It is sweet, savory, tangy and spicy, the thick consistency makes this sauce the perfect compliment. Honestly, I was asking if they can bottle up this sauce. ⁣

Don’t forget to pair your meal with their shrimp dumpling soup. Wrapped with fresh shrimp, minced meat and crunchy water chestnut, the plump dumpling was packed generously with ingredients and every bite made me crave another. ⁣

⁣
One of the offerings on Miss Vanda is the Labyrinth signature “Ang Moh” Chicken Rice. Chef Han’s grandma used to work as landlady and housekeeper cooking for a British family. Hence, this is her version of the quintessential Hainanese Chicken Rice. The aromatic chicken rice is served with juicy free range Kampong chicken and creamy chicken and mushroom sauce, complete with the nicely charred crispy rice bits. This is like the Singaporean risotto. ⁣
⁣
We love the Wagyu Buah Keluak Rendang. They slow braised it overnight, hence it is so tender. And the flavours are enriched with buah keluak, which is known as Asia’s truffle.⁣
⁣
Their Seafood Laksa is super rich and creamy. It is served with grilled Argentinian red prawns,  local green lip mussels, homemade fish paste and crabmeat dumplings. We also had the boneless Crispy Har Cheong Chicken Wings and Hainanese Style Sweet and Sour Sakura Pork Tomahawk.⁣
⁣
Don’t forget to get a bottle of Hainanese Kaya for breakfast the next day. It is made with fresh coconut milk, local organic free range eggs and young pandan leaves, gently stirred for over 2-3 hours. ⁣
⁣
Minimum spending is $50. They are open 7 days a week and they do islandwide delivery at $10 flat fee no matter where you stay or work. Self pick is also available, at Esplanade Mall 02-23. ⁣

I used brown sugar instead of regular white sugar, and the resulting egg tarts had a good amount of caramel smokiness to them. Using frozen prata to replace the typical shortcrust tart shell is certainly a stroke of genius, because it reduces the preparation time by a lot.

This recipe makes egg tarts that are closer in taste and texture to Portuguese egg tarts, with a flaky, crispy crust and smooth, egg custard centre.

Try out this recipe for @milosingapore Bread “Tiramisu” that you can make in just 30 minutes!

Be generous with the Milo powder, because who doesn’t love that chocolatey, malty goodness? Bonus: adding Milo powder on top creates a brittle, sweet layer.

.
I have to admit, it’s frustrating when you’re ‘hangry’ and the network connection somehow chooses that moment to glitch. All the dim sum items you’ve added into your cart? Deleted, and now you have to start over again.
.
Even if we don’t order delivery as much since dine-in is available from 19 June onwards, working from home has made me realise how much we rely on fast network connections –and how frustrating it is when glitches happen, like our trippy glitched post yesterday.

If you’re tired of slow network connections glitching up your life, #ditchyourglitch and try the #gigaexperience.

@gigaexperience's newest, best plan weighs in at 40GB for S$20 with no contract (price reverts to 40GB for S$30 after 12 months). You can rollover your data, so there’s no wastage of unused data!

.
Let’s explore a different side of desserts and sweet treats, with Anthony Bourdain’s Candied Sweet Potatoes with Bourbon.
.
Together with the bourbon sauce, it was an absolute delight. The butter and sugar in the sauce left a creamy mouthfeel, while a hint of tartness from the apple cider played on my palate. The alcohol content from the bourbon and cider would’ve burnt off during the cooking process, so all that’s left of the bourbon was mostly deep notes of caramel, vanilla and molasses.

One of the waffles to look forward to would certainly have to be the Horlick Waffles (S$9) that's covered with a shower of almond crunch and a dusting of malty Horlicks powder. Crisp on the outside and pillowy in the centre, these waffles looked as good as they taste!

.
Can you believe that for just S$68, you can enjoy this sumptuous spread from the Zi Char menu for 5 pax? I have to admit, my family ended up saving the leftovers for dinner too – there was just so much delicious food!
.
The Zi Char menu features staples like Braised Ee Fu Noodles with Baby Abalone and Wok Fried White Pepper Clams, and more unconventional dishes like Signature Salted Egg Yolk Beancurd.
.
But my favourite has got to be our local signature dish, the Chilli Crab (add-on S$15). Drenched in a thick, rich chilli crab sauce that has egg strands in it, this was a massive crab. The crab claws are cracked beforehand, so it’s simply a matter of scooping out the sweet, juicy crabmeat. Truly, the star of the show.

The subs came in cardboard boxes which reminded me of those you might spot at a food festival. Each sub came with a side of plain nachos, in case you want to dip into the bountiful toppings sitting atop your sub.

Super Sub had a plethora of gourmet options, and I decided to try some of their more famous toppings. Super Sub’s Fiery Chic Bolognese (S$7.80) is one of their best-sellers, and for good reason. Topped with lettuce, cherry tomatoes, jalapeno, mayonnaise and cheddar cheese, this tomato-based sub may look rather unassuming at first glance as compared to the others.

Pierre Hermé’s 5-Ingredient Chocolate Cake recipe is simple enough, and yields an absolutely heavenly cake. Imagine the soft, crumbly texture of butter cookies, but with the rich, decadent bittersweet notes of dark chocolate.

You might even want to pair your chocolate cake with the most classic of accompaniments: vanilla ice cream. Creamy and cold to the warm and crumbly chocolate cake, this is sure to sate even the direst dessert cravings.

If you leave it in the fridge overnight, it gets a lot denser and more fudgey. Mmm, delicious.

MATCHA ESPRESSO ICE CUBES?!
The weather is getting really hot lately and since adding ice to coffee usually dilutes it, I decided to freeze the espresso shots to preserve the flavour and intensity with some matcha!
.
Steps
1️⃣ Prepare Espresso Shot (40ml) from the Nespresso machine and freeze it overnight. This is so convenient and saves time to make coffee every morning
2️⃣ Each Nespresso Ice Cube Tray is 30ml so 9 of them requires 270ml of espresso shot
3️⃣ Add your desired number of espresso ice cubes prepared in 1️⃣ into empty glass
4️⃣ Fill up the glass with whisked matcha (1g matcha powder to 100 ml hot water)
5️⃣ I’m using Ceremonial grade Matcha which interestingly turned out sweet when milk is added
6️⃣ Fill up the glass with 150ml of Fresh Milk

HARD FOAM LATTE?!
Celebrating World Environment Day (5 June) tomorrow with Nespresso (@Nespresso.SG) who has partnered with National Geographic (@NatGeo) this year in their support for farmers in places such as Uganda, Colombia and Zimbabwe to sustainably source coffee and make a difference which also helps to revive the war-torn regions
.
This Hard Foam Latte is no different from other lattes, but this simple cup of coffee can help to make a positive difference:
1️⃣ Prepare 1-2 shots of Espresso from the Nespresso machine to yield 40ml of Espresso (I’m using double shots 80ml)
2️⃣ Using Nespresso Aeroccino, pour 100ml of Fresh Milk and give it a short press to create Hot Milk Foam (Long press for 2s for Cold Milk Foam)
3️⃣ Scoop the Hot Milk Foam onto the espresso shot prepared in 1️⃣
4️⃣ Let the Milk Foam settle for 3 minutes exactly
5️⃣ Pour 100ml of Fresh Milk at one spot in the middle of the cup so that the hardened milk foam will rise evenly
6️⃣ Sprinkle some cinnamon powder or cocoa powder for extra indulgence

Pat dry chic wings before you begin. Dust them liberally in a coating of plain flour, salt and pepper and set aside.

Make the glaze with two teaspoons is light soy sauce, two teaspoons of cheapo honey, three teaspoons of plain water, one chopped cloves of garlic. For added spiciness, you can choose to add chilli or Szechuan pepper or both if you choose to turn the heat levels up.

Pan fry the coated wings in a pan of oil for roughly 5 minutes. Once they are properly browned, transfer to an oven tray lined with baking paper and roast the wings for about 15 minutes at 180 deg Celsius. Take them out to glaze the the wings on both sides with the soy honey glaze, and return to the oven for another 10 minutes.

Serve with sides of your choice. Here, we have them sitting a bed of homemade mashed potatoes and boiled spinach, and cherry tomatoes. For this plate you see here, the cost of ingredients is less than $10 to feed easily two :)))))",679,2,"['Delicious', 'Delicious 👍']"

In a pan of oil, lightly sauté the prawns on each side for a minute or 2. Remove the prawns and in the same pan, add a knob of butter and enough Arborio risotto rice for 2.

Toast for a few minutes before adding a dash of white wine. Burn off the wine for a few minutes before adding 3 ladles of prawn stock at medium heat and stir. Once the broth has been absorbed by the rice, add another ladle and stir again. Season with 1 tsp salt.

Keep repeating until the rice puffs up and is not too hard nor too mushy, about 20 minutes or so. Around 15 minutes, add some green peas. Once the rice is fully cooked, turn off the flame and add in a 2 thick slabs of butter, grated parmesan or parmigiana.

Stir well to emulsify the butter and toss to get it super creamy and delicious like seen in the video. To serve, spoon risotto into the center of a plate and shake the plate to let the rice naturally spread out to form a circular disc shape.

Add the sualor prawns on top and enjoy!

Set your bread maker to bread dough mode and let the machine do its magic. When it is done, pour the dough onto a flour dusted table. Cut the dough into 9 equal portions.

In a rice cooker with one cup of washed and rinsed rice, add chopped mushrooms. You can choose whatever mushrooms and do not worry about the quantity, the mushrooms will shrink during cooking so add as much as you like.

Add 2 slices of chopped bacon for some meaty influence, and green peas for colour and crunch. Add one cup of water seasoned with a tsp of light soya for flavour.

Put everything in the rice cooker and let it cook on normal mode until it’s done. When it’s cooked, open and season with fresh black pepper and serve.

Enjoy :))))) Check out my profile story highlights for the full video snippets.",1127,20,"['@oh.jyy', 'Can we add corns instead of green peas?', 'This method works well too with spinach, pumpkin, mushrooms and a knob of butter.

28/6/2020,thesilverchef,"What’s good with white rice, Kung Pao Chicken of course. Here’s how to do it again.

Marinate about 250g chopped to chunks chicken with 1 tbsp corn flour, 1 tbsp light soya and 1 tbsp Chinese wine. Mix and coat everything evenly.

Make a sauce by mixing 1 tbsp sugar, 1 tbsp corn flour, 1 tbsp light soya, 1 tbsp dark vinegar and 3 tbsp water in a bowl and set aside.

Heat up a wok with oil at medium flame. Once the oil is hot, fry a handful of chopped dried chilli and a handful of Szechuan peppercorns until they are fragrant.

Add the marinated chicken and stir well. Once the chicken is cooked in a few minutes, add 2 stalks of chopped scallion, 4 cloves of garlic that have been peeled and cut into halves and 6 slices of ginger. Toss and stir well again, it should smell incredibly aromatic by now.

Next add the sauce which will give the chicken a shiny gloss like the livery on an F1 car. Keep tossing. The last part is to simply add baked or cooked cashew nuts for a lovely crunch.

To serve, you can pour it on a sharing plate or do what we did here, that is to spoon the chicken onto a bowl of piping hot white rice.

26/6/2020,thesilverchef,"We made the silky smooth Velvet Congee again today, but had it with century egg and pork balls, similar to those at the “Jewelry green” outlets hehe.

The simple trick to getting this broken rice like texture is very easy. It’s using a combination of rice, three parts normal rice (preferably Japanese or Taiwanese rice) to one part glutinous rice. So for 2 persons, you need half cup rice in total, so mix well 3/8 cup of normal rice to 1/8 cup glutinous rice. Then you always need 8 times more water, in this case 4 cups of water or stock for even a better flavour profile.

So add the 2 types rice and water into the rice cooker. As we are using garoupa as our protein later, we flavour this congee with one slice of dried abalone and a few pieces of dried scallops for that ocean taste. Then set your rice cooker to cook for 3.5 hours for maximum congee joy.

An hour into cooking, add a few slices of ginger and some white bits of scallion. Marinate 150g mince pork with 3 slices ginger, 2 chopped garlic, 1/2 tsp salt, 1 tsp Chinese wine, 1 tsp sesame oil, 1 tsp 5 spice powder, 1 tsp plain flour and a dash of white pepper. Mix well and let it rest for 5 minutes.

Half an hour before the congee time is up, simply add the pork balls and sliced century eggs into the rice cooker. And once the congee is fully cooked, season with one tsp salt. You can add more if you prefer a stronger taste.

To serve, pour into large round bowls and garnish with more slices of ginger and the green bits of scallion. Then it should look similar to those you find at you know where. The texture should be silky and velvety, and the rice fairly broken down from the long cooking time. It should taste thoroughly comforting too :))))) Check out my profile story highlights for the full video snippets.",803,18,"['😋😋😋 Wow', 'omy, make me feel like having congee now...🤤', '@thesilverchef may i know if its possible to achieve this texture with brown rice?', '😍😋', ""My rice cooker doesn't have a porridge option, how would you recommend cooking this on the stovetop."", 'Thanks for sharing the recipe in detail, can’t wait to try to cook this dish! 🙏', 'Looks damn good!', '❤️', '😋😋😋😋😋']"

25/6/2020,thesilverchef,"Sua Lor Prawn Aglio Olio, updated recipe of one of our favourite pasta dishes with a few improvements.

Start with 6 sua lor prawns from @lyhseafood for 2 persons. Deshell and devein the shrimp and separate them. Boil tagliatelle from @barilla for exactly 5 minutes and strain. Keep the pasta water.

In a pan of oil, lightly sauté the prawns on each side. Prawns cook very fast, so it will take only a minute or so to cook. Remove but use the same pan to cook the heads until they turn pink. Then add 2 ladles of pasta water and simmer for 5 minutes. Strain and keep the prawn stock.

In a pan, drizzle enough extra virgin olive oil to create a thin film of bathing oil. Add 2 cloves of thinly sliced garlic and 6 cherry tomatoes, halved. Let them bathe in the oil to make an aromatic garlic oil. Next add some chopped basil, be sure to keep another batch of same amount of basil for the finishing later.

Add a tbsp butter and let it monte the pan. In French cooking, monte usually comes at the end to make the sauce more rich and luxurious, but we are using butter to add flavour and richness. As the butter is melted, add the prawn stock to make the final sauce.

Once the sauce is boiling, add the pasta and quickly stir to get the pasta to absorb all the prawn and basil goodness. If you can toss the noodles, even better. The secret here is to make the pasta absorb the saucy liquid until it reduces to a creamy consistency.

To finish, turn off heat and add the prawns and the balance of basil and another tbsp of butter and monte or mantecare one last time. Stirring and tossing adds air to emulsify the butter into the sauce, giving it a rich creamy and glossy finish.

To serve, refer to our videos to see how it can be plated nicely. Trust us, you will only eat this at home even after the crisis is over :))))) Check out my profile story highlights for the full video snippets.",529,3,"['this recipe saves lives! 😭', '👌🔥😋😋']"
25/6/2020,thesilverchef,"Today is Dragon Boat Festival! Here is our recipe for this again in the event you are thinking of making this today.

Start by soaking 500g glutinous rice, 12 chestnuts and bamboo leaves overnight. Also, soak about 6 dried mushrooms for 2 hours.

Marinate 250g pork shoulder or belly with 1 tbsp light soya, 1 tbsp dark soya, 1 tbsp sesame oil, 1 tbsp oyster sauce, 3 minced garlic, 1 chopped shallot and some 5 spice powder. Add a dash of white pepper also.

In a wok of oil, fry 3 minced garlic and 1 chopped shallot until fragrant. Add the glutinous rice and mix well. Season with 1 tbsp light soya, 1 tbsp dark soya, 1 tbsp sesame oil, 1 tbsp oyster sauce and some 5 spice powder. Stir until the rice is evenly coated, then set aside and let it cool down.

In a fresh wok of oil, fry another 3 minced garlic, a handful of dried shrimp and 1 chopped shallot until fragrant. Add the marinated pork, dried mushrooms and chestnuts. Fry and stir until everything is properly mixed. After about 5 minutes, set aside and let it cool down.

For each dumping take 2 bamboo leaves and fold at the center to form a triangle cup as seen in the video. Spoon some rice to fill one third of the capacity. Add a chestnut and a piece of pork.

Then add a chestnut, half a mushroom, some braised peanuts (from can) and half a salted egg yolk. You can also add an abalone as an option.

Fold the the flap of the lead to cover the base of the dumpling and fold in any other flap. Ensure it is tight and there are no gaps to form a taut pyramid shape.

We tie the dumpling strings to a hangar, but you can improvise with whatever is convenient. Use the string to tie around the dumpling and ensure it is tight. Make 12 dumplings with this recipe.

Then boil the dumplings in a wok of water for 45 minutes and it should be done. If you didn’t leave any gaps, the dumpling should look firm and neat.

We still need more practice with our dumpling tying skills, but this way is certainly more affordable than buying commercial ones outside.

21/6/2020,thesilverchef,"Basting Steaks, using the lovely tenderloins from @thegoodmeatstore.

Here’s a quick recap on how to cook beautiful steaks with a golden brown crust and medium rare doneness.

First, you need to have a good cut - ribeye, striploin or tenderloin would be best. Avoid spending money on expensive Wagyu for this, an Aussie angus will do nicely.

Next, make sure your steak is at room temperature before you cook it, and pat dry on both sides so that there is no excess moisture. Then, season liberally with sea salt or course salt. Do likewise with black pepper.

The issue with most home cooked steaks is usually the pan is not hot enough, and you don’t get that golden crust. So make sure you heat up your pan with a shallow film of oil for a few minutes before you put the meat in.

You must get a beautiful sizzling sound when the beef hits the pan, and just leave it. You only need to turn once. After about 2 minutes, turn and you should get a nice golden brown crust. Add a tbsp butter and baste, which means using a spoon and quickly take some butter juice and pour over the top of the steak repeatedly as seen in the video. Cook for another 2 minutes.

For most ribeye and striploin cuts, the entire steak can usually cook in just the pan, but tenderloin and thicker cuts may need an extra time in the oven. If so, send the steak to the oven at 180 Celsius for another 2 to 3 minutes.

Once the steak is cooked to medium rare, you need to rest it for another 3 minutes or so. Make sure you don’t forget this as if not, your steak will not be as juicy. Once it’s properly rested, take a sharp knife and you should easily cut through the steak like butter.

You should get a ideal pink medium rare, and a juicy and tender texture. The basting will give it a lovely buttery beef flavour, and every bite should be nirvana for steak lovers :)))))",425,3,"['Drooling! 🤤', '❤️🔥👏😍Always looking so good!', 'Super! ❤️❤️❤️ Awesome cooking tips!']"

21/6/2020,thesilverchef,"Homemade Nasi Lemak.

Here’s our little take on this popular breakfast classic. It’s quite straightforward, just some effort to make the individual components.

First cook the coconut rice by adding some chopped pandan leaves, half cup of cream, 1 cup water to 1 cup of basmati rice. Normal rice will do also. Then let the rice cook until it’s done at normal rice cooker mode.

Fry some dried anchovies or ikan bilis in pan of oil until they are crispy delicious. Similarly, use the same pan to fry some raw peanuts until they are crispy on the outside too. Set both aside.

In a fresh pan with oil, sauté one sliced red onion until the onions are soft. Then add a few tbsp of sambal chilli or belachan. We happen to have our mum in law homemade one, and will share a recipe for this in a later post.

Fry until The onions and sambal are utterly aromatic. You can choose to add a few of the fried ikan bilis inside too. Add some tamarind juice and a tsp sugar and mix well. Once the juice has been reduced, your sambal paste is ready.

Cook a sunny side up egg as an accompaniment. Make sure only cook until the whites are set and leave the yolk creamy yolky.

To plate, simply pour some rice into a small bowl and flip it onto a plate or better, a banana leaf lined plate. Then simply add the egg on top of the rice, and the sambal, peanuts, ikan bilis and some sliced cucumbers by the side.

And it’s done! What we enjoy is the lovely lemak notes from the rice, beautifully contrasted with the kick of the sambal and the crunch of the ikan bilis and peanuts.

A fried chicken wing would be great too, but for us, this simpler version is just a joy to eat :))))) Check out my profile story highlights for the full video snippets.",647,14,"['i want to try this 🤤❤️', '🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤', 'My all time fav....🤤❤️', 'Shiok', 'Hello.

21/6/2020,thesilverchef,"A Doriyaki Hotdog.

Using the same Doriyaki pancake recipe, we did a simple hotdog using a Doriyaki pancake as a wrapper.

You need 80g plain flour, 40g sugar, honey, baking powder, 2 eggs, oil and water.

Make the batter first by adding the sugar into a bowl and add one tbsp honey. Break two eggs and whisk like there’s no tomorrow hehe. This is to introduce air into the mixture and after a few minutes, the mixture will start to foam and turn paler, and will have more liquid. This is a much better way to use your whisking muscles than to make some diabetic Korean kopi C which we will also never make here hehe.

Once the egg mixture is foamy and has a nice viscosity, add the 80g flour and half tsp baking powder and stir subtly until it foams into a nice yellow and eggy batter. Refrigerate for 15 minutes and after taking it out, add one tbsp plain water just to loosen the batter.

In a non stick pan, pour a ladle of egg batter into the centre and let it naturally spread out to form a round pancake shape. It will cook very quickly in a minute or two, so use a spatula to loosen the edges and get ready to flip.

Once it’s dry on the bottom side, quickly flip and cook the other side, which will tend to cook faster as the pan gets hotter.

Marinate 250g pork chopped into chunks with 1 tbsp light soya, 1 tbsp sesame oil, 1 tbsp Chinese wine and some black pepper. We using pork loin though you can use any pork, even minced pork for this simple dish.

Cut a potato or 2 into thin slices or discs. Then in a wok, add a tsp butter and some oil and heat it up until the butter fizzles. Add the potato and fry until they are soft.

Then add the pork and cook until the meat is mostly cooked. Then add some water and starch slurry solution to make a thickened sauce. Add a tsp of dark soya also.

Then add some baby spinach and cook and mix until the vegetables are soft, which is about a minute or so. Then add some black pepper and serve.

Some days it’s too cumbersome to do the full Hokkien Mee recipe, we decided to do a shortened version. We finally got our hands on sua lor prawns also from @lyhseafood and they make the best broth for this, and the meat is so crunchy and qq.

Deshell 14 prawns and fry the shells and heads in oil in a pot until they turn reddish pink and smells amazing. Then add water and simmer for at least 20 minutes.

Sauté the prawns themselves in a wok of oil for one minute each side and quickly remove them. In the same wok with the aromatic prawn oil, sauté a chopped garlic until its fragrant.

Then add some minced pork, we using the leftover xlb filling from @paradisegrpsg from lunch. Once the minced is cooked, add yellow noodles. We using the ones from @fortunefoodmfgsg.

Then add 3 ladles of the prawn stock and use a pair of tongs to separate the noodle strands as they will be clumped together initially. If can, toss the wok as it will help the noodles to absorb the broth faster.

Once it gets dry, add more stock and repeat this for a few times until the noodles turn creamy and luscious. Then season with a tsp light soya, white pepper and as an optional, coriander powder or 5 spice powder.

Then add some leafy greens like the nai bai we using today and toss some more to cook  the vegetables quickly. Then turn off the flame, and add some oil or lard oil and black pepper. Give one final toss to emulsify the noodles into a shiny creamy noodley goodness.

Then pour into a bowl and enjoy!

Now you can try your hand at making the same xlb you get at paradise dynasty, which happens to be our favourite xlb joint too.

Each kit comes with a set of wrappers, pork filling and a bamboo steamer similar to the ones at their restaurants. You can make up to 16 dumplings and this comes at a price of $23.80 which you can order directly from online platforms or as a takeaway.

As the wrappers are already made, all you need to do is just thaw the ingredients in advance and make each dumpling by hand. Spoon some filling into a wrapper and make 18 folds at the top. Pinch and close the dumpling and that’s it.

Make 8 different coloured ones as each steamer can hold up to 8 dumplings. Simply steam them for 7 minutes and it’s done! Easy. Just need to practice the folds though, as it needs a little of a nimble set of hands and some getting used to.

Understandably, some of us are still apprehensive about venturing out to eat, especially this Dad day weekend, so we thought of showing you a few dishes you can do to celebrate this Sunday.

We got this lovely red emperor snapper from our favourite fish source, @lyhseafood and thought of doing the classic nanyang dish.

Prepare the tamarind juice by dissolving 2 tbsp tamarind water in a cup of water. Strain the juice free of the seeds and set aside.

Make the rempah paste by blitzing 4 garlic, 3 shallots, 1 lemongrass stalk, 1 fresh chilli, 1 dried chilli that have seeds removed and 1 block of belachan paste with some water.

In a wok of oil, fry off the rempah until the kitchen is abundant with belachan pungency, which will turn amazingly aromatic in time. Then break some kaffir lime leaves over the paste and add them into the mix.

Next, add a handful of chopped okra and one chopped tomato. Stir well. Then add the tamarind juice and another cup of water. Try not to buy those bottled tamarind juice as they won’t taste as good.

Bring everything to a boil and let it simmer for 5 minutes. Then add the red snapper fish cut into chunks. You can use any fish for that matter, but red snapper is just amazeballs here. Add some lemon juice and fresh parleys or Vietnamese mint.

Let the fish cook for around 10 minutes or until the meat is fully cooked. Then simply pour everything into a bowl and served with white rice. For a proper family celebration, you can pair with other dishes from some of our previous recipes.

Truth be told, we are never the biggest fans of chilli crab as most commercial ones use ketchup, and we prefer fresh sauces. So the next best thing is to do a chilli crab sauce with freshly made tagliatelle.

Blitz one shallot, 2 garlic and one chilli with some water in a blender until you get a nice moist paste. Then prepare the fresh pasta which is in our earlier post this morning.

Fry the chilli paste in a pan of oil until it’s amazingly aromatic. Then add a tsp of tau chui or fermented bean paste. If you don’t have this, just replace with a tsp salt or a tbsp light soya to give it savouriness.

Stir and mix well. Then add 5 tbsp tomato purée. You can use a few tbsp of ketchup to substitute but seriously, fresh tomato flavours are better. Stir well again.

Add a few ladles of unsalted stock or water and bring to a boil. Then add a tbsp of butter and stir until the butter melts. Sprinkle some coriander powder if available. Add in 150g of crabmeat or roughly a cup worth and let them all simmer for around 5 minutes.

As this is fresh pasta, we prefer to just blanche it right before putting in the pan of sauce. A quick boil of 20 seconds in boiling water will do, then immediately transfer to the pan of chilli crab sauce.

Mix well and toss and the saucy crab sauce will disappear into the pasta very quickly. Once it’s almost dry, turn off the flame and add in a tbsp of butter and give one final toss to get it utterly creamy. And you are done.

Simply twirl the pasta on a plate and garnish with some chopped scallion on top.

Pour 2 cups of plain flour onto a table and make a well in the center. Crack 3 small eggs into the well and use a fork to whisk the eggs. Don’t worry if they leak out of the well, simply mix the flour with the egg mixture a shaggy wet dough starts to form.

Once enough flour and eggs are incorporated and it gets mode solid, start using your hands to knead the dough for about 6 minutes or so. You will end up with a drier smoother round ball dough after all the flour has been absorbed.

Cover with a cling wrap and let it rest for 20 minutes. After resting, place the dough ball back onto the table and cut into 2 equal halves. With each half, you can make a person worth portion of tagliatelle.

First flatten the halved dough with your palm into a pancake thick shape. Then use a rolling pin and start rolling out into a wider and thin sheet. You will know when it is thin enough when the sheet becomes slightly translucent and you can barely see through it to see the table underneath.

Then fold the bottom third in, then the top third over the other two thirds. Take a dough cutter or a knife, simply cut into tagliatelle sized noodles.

After that, simply spread and loosen the noodles. And let them rest for a few minutes before cooking them. Dust a bit more flour to prevent them from sticking.

Start by making the pasta sheets. Pour 2 cups of plain flour onto a table and make a well in the center. Crack 3 small eggs into the well and use a fork to whisk the eggs.

Once enough flour and eggs are incorporated, start using your hands to knead the dough for about 6 minutes or so. You will end up with a drier smoother round ball dough after all the flour has been absorbed.

Cover with a cling wrap and let it rest for 20 minutes. After resting, place the dough ball back onto the table and cut into 2 equal halves. With each half, you can make one lasagne.

Use a rolling pin to roll out the pasta and measure with your baking dish to cut out 3 sheets that will cover each layer of lasagne.

You can use our previous Bolognese recipe for the filling, or simply use 2 packets of wagyu Bolognese from @shinsengrocer.

Make a bechamel sauce. Create a simple roux with one tbsp butter and 2 tsp plain flour in a saucepan. Turn on at low flame and slowly wipe the butter around flour filled pan to absorb all the flour.

You will end up with a yellow thick paste. Add fresh milk slowly and let it mix with the roux. The milk will quickly thicken up. Just keep adding until you get a sauce like consistency like what you see in the video. Add grated cheddar and parmesan. Season with black pepper.

Start layering the baking dish with a layer of Bolognese, followed by a pasta sheet. Boil the sheet for 10 seconds prior to placing in the dish. Then add mozzarella cheese and spoon enough bechamel sauce to cover the layer.

Then repeat the same meat, pasta, mozzarella and bechamel layer. For the last layer, add the meat and pasta sheet first. Then add the bechamel layer before adding the mozzarella and some parmesan.

Bake the lasagne in a preheated oven at 180 Celsius no fan for 45 minutes. Once it’s done baking, remove from oven and rest for 20 minutes before eating.

14/6/2020,thesilverchef,"Oxtail Stew.

You will need oxtails, one celery, one onion and one carrot are the basic ingredients. Red wine, one third can of cherry tomatoes, water and flour round up the rest.

Always brown your meat, in this case, oxtails in a cold pan under low heat. You don’t need oil as the beef has enough fat, and this will render the fat as well.

In a large pot, make a mirepoix, a fancy French word for 爆香, using diced onion, celery and carrot. Keep sautéing until they are soft and aromatic, hence the “Xiang” aspect. Add the seared oxtails into the pot and stir if you want to, though you don’t have to. Just look kinda chefy in case an immediate family is curiously looking on wondering what that gorgeous smell is.

Then add enough red wine. Now never ask a French cook how much, and I will never know, just add until you think it is enough. It is one of those things that it will have that magical wine notes at the end no matter what.

Now add enough water to cover the oxtails. If you have beef stock, better. But where to find beef bones to make stock, but if u do, I will be your best friend now.

Add a third of a can of cherry tomatoes, though plump ones will do as well. Try using Italian ones if possible, cos Italian produce just rocks.

That’s the hard part. Now all u need to do is bring everything to a boil, then lower it to simmering rolling boil. Which means the broth can see only one or two bubbles rolling away, and this is the ideal time to try the Iphone 11 slo mo video shot.

Be sure to check every half hour and top up water, don’t want this delicious dish to burn. I find watching Netflix sitcoms like Big Bang theory or modern family best for the intervals, or if u have an Apple Watch, set that timer which u never thought was useful.

Just an hour or less before that four hours cooking time, add 3 tbsp of plain flour to thicken the sauce and give it a nice glossy look.

Indeed, the Simon Road uncle has been frying this for decades and it’s one of only 3 hkm which we frequent. His is the dry version which is, we feel, the right way to eat this classic. We hardly touch those super wet and moaty ones.

Fried noodle dishes need to absorb all the stock into the noodles so that the noodles are properly flavoured. That’s why we dislike the soupy ones as they tend to lack that perfect alchemy of flavours, and some can still taste the kee or lye taste of the yellow noodles.

Simon road uncle will always fry and braise the noodles until their tasty broth is fully incorporated, along with the rest of the egg and garlic fragrance, and tinged with a wok hei aroma, it’s quite sensational from first bite till last.

His son, Youri has been learning the ropes and has since picked up most of his dad frying skills, and trust us, it is something that takes time to get this good. Those who have tried our own rendition of hkm will appreciate the efforts just to prepare.

Steam for 20 minutes. Open the lid and use a fork to fluff up the rice. Steam for another 5 minutes. Then set aside.

In a pot, add one block of gula melaka or palm sugar, roughly 50g and 60ml water. Add 100g of grated coconut and some more strips of pandan leaves. Stir until the sugar is melted.

Once the sugar is melted and the coconut is coloured an orange, slightly brown colour thoroughly, add a knob of butter and a flour slurry solution. Stir well until you get a coconut paste.

Cut each banana leaf 24cm by 14cm. Then use a ramekin to measure each kueh size, and add glutinous rice in it and flip it onto the leaf. Add some coconut topping on top.

As seen in the video, fold in the longer sides of the lead inward to cover but leave a gap at the center to expose the coconut. Then fold the sides underneath to form a neatly shaped kueh shape, almost like a rice dumpling.

11/6/2020,thesilverchef,"Teriyaki Confit Trout from @shinsengrocer.

One of the best ways to cook fish is using the confit method. It is essentially a gentle poach in flavoured oil that results in a very moist and tender flesh, and looks almost uncooked in a way.

Essentially the fish protein is cooked yet retains almost all the moisture and it will have a wondrous texture to the fish. Today we are using a teriyaki marinated trout from @shinsengrocer. As always, pat dry the fish prior to cooking.

Start by pouring enough oil to submerge the entire fish in a saucepan. Add a few sprigs of thyme, a few garlic cloves and some slices of lemon. Then heat it up slowly until it reaches 60 Celsius. You will need a kitchen thermometer to measure this.

Once it reaches 60 Celsius, put the trout inside the pan, and ensure the entire fish is covered in oil. Turn the heat to its lowest flame. The temperature should be maintained between 60 to 65 degrees during the cooking duration. Cook for 10 minutes.

Once the fish is cooked for 10 minutes, remove from the pan. As there is still sufficient teriyaki marinate left to make a sauce, we can use this.

Make a roux by adding one tbsp butter to 2 tsp plain flour in a clean saucepan. Let the butter absorb all the flour before slowly adding the teriyaki sauce and slowly stir until a saucy consistency is reached.

To serve, boil some nai bai as a side. Spoon some sauce at the bottom of the plate. Then add the nai bai, followed by the cooked trout. Quenelle some white truffle paste from @shinsengrocer and add some lemon zest on top to finish.

The joy of eating confit fish is the amazing texture, and you can cook thick red fish like salmon this way too. Enjoy :))))) Check out my profile story highlights for the full video snippets.",281,6,"['Beautiful 🤤', 'Do you re-use the oil?', '😘😋😘😋']"
11/6/2020,thesilverchef,"Potato Gratin, a simple and delicious French classic.

This is so ridiculously easy to do at home, and will taste so good you wonder why you haven’t tried this earlier.

Start by slicing thinly 4 potatoes and 1 onion. Make a simple roux with one tbsp butter and 2 tsp plain flour in a saucepan. Turn on at low flame and slowly wipe the butter around flour filled pan to absorb all the flour.

You will end up with a yellow thick paste. Add fresh milk slowly and let it mix with the roux. The milk will quickly thicken up. Just keep adding until you get a sauce like consistency like what you see in the video. This is known as a bechamel sauce. Season with a tsp salt and black pepper and set aside.

In a baking dish, layer the onions first on the base of the dish. Then cover the onions fully with a layer of potatoes. Make sure it’s neatly packed.

Spoon the bechamel sauce over the potatoes, and make sure the sauce has fully covered the potatoes also. Then repeat another layer of onions, potatoes and bechamel sauce.

After pouring in the last of the sauce, and ensuring the potatoes are fully submerged in bechamel, sprinkle grated parmesan to fully cover the potato and sauce. We using parmigiana reggiano as it’s just so so good.

Then bake in the oven at 180 Celsius no fan for around 45 minutes. You should get a deliciously tempting golden crust and an accompanying gorgeous aroma to go along with it. If your potatoes are still not soft enough and you are afraid the crust will burn, simply cover the top with an aluminium foil.

Once it’s fully done, take it out and garnish with chopped parsley and fresh pepper. The inside should be creamy once the sauce has been reduced and the combination of potato, onion and meltingly crusty cheese should be undeniably additive :))))) Check out my profile story highlights for the full video snippets.",754,19,"['😍😍😍', 'Please, no onion but garlic.', 'What kind of potatoes will you recommend for this dish pls?', ""The recipe doesn't need bechamel only cream,patatoes and slide garlic."", 'How much fresh milk to thicken the sauce ?

11/6/2020,thesilverchef,"Red Bean Pancakes, here is the recipe again for those who missed it the first time.

You will need 50g rice flour, 50g plain flour, one egg white and 1 tsp salt. That’s about it, and a good non stick pan.

Mix the two flours, egg white and salt in a mixing bowl and whisk gently until you form a smooth batter.

In a non stick pan, do not oil the pan like most recipes suggest, we find it oil can break the crepe batter easily, but you do need practice in getting this part right. Do not turn on the flame at this point.

Use a ladle and spoon a ladle worth of batter and pour it in the center of the pan and tilt the pan until it fills up every corner, and making sure the batter is still thin enough. Try not to add additional batter in empty spots as this will make the crepe uneven.

Then turn on the flame at its lowest setting and slowly cook the crepe. Will take a few minutes for the batter to dry and the crepe to form. When it’s cooked, it will have a rubbery texture at the edges, use a thin spatula and gently roll and fold the crepe into an empty popiah. Then roll it off onto a plate.

Rinse the pan to cool down and repeat until your batter is finished. Then, with each crepe, add some red bean paste in the centre and fold at each of the 4 sides into a parcel, and flip over.

Now to deep fry. In a wok of boiling hot oil, gently slice each parcel into the oil and deep fry until golden brown, only a few minutes each side.

Remove when done and drain the pancakes of any excess oil and they are done! It should taste crispy and eggy, and delicious for an afternoon snack.

26/6/2020,thesilverchef,"We made the silky smooth Velvet Congee again today, but had it with century egg and pork balls, similar to those at the “Jewelry green” outlets hehe.

The simple trick to getting this broken rice like texture is very easy. It’s using a combination of rice, three parts normal rice (preferably Japanese or Taiwanese rice) to one part glutinous rice. So for 2 persons, you need half cup rice in total, so mix well 3/8 cup of normal rice to 1/8 cup glutinous rice. Then you always need 8 times more water, in this case 4 cups of water or stock for even a better flavour profile.

So add the 2 types rice and water into the rice cooker. As we are using garoupa as our protein later, we flavour this congee with one slice of dried abalone and a few pieces of dried scallops for that ocean taste. Then set your rice cooker to cook for 3.5 hours for maximum congee joy.

An hour into cooking, add a few slices of ginger and some white bits of scallion. Marinate 150g mince pork with 3 slices ginger, 2 chopped garlic, 1/2 tsp salt, 1 tsp Chinese wine, 1 tsp sesame oil, 1 tsp 5 spice powder, 1 tsp plain flour and a dash of white pepper. Mix well and let it rest for 5 minutes.

Half an hour before the congee time is up, simply add the pork balls and sliced century eggs into the rice cooker. And once the congee is fully cooked, season with one tsp salt. You can add more if you prefer a stronger taste.

To serve, pour into large round bowls and garnish with more slices of ginger and the green bits of scallion. Then it should look similar to those you find at you know where. The texture should be silky and velvety, and the rice fairly broken down from the long cooking time. It should taste thoroughly comforting too :))))) Check out my profile story highlights for the full video snippets.",803,18,"['😋😋😋 Wow', 'omy, make me feel like having congee now...🤤', '@thesilverchef may i know if its possible to achieve this texture with brown rice?', '😍😋', ""My rice cooker doesn't have a porridge option, how would you recommend cooking this on the stovetop."", 'Thanks for sharing the recipe in detail, can’t wait to try to cook this dish! 🙏', 'Looks damn good!', '❤️', '😋😋😋😋😋']"

25/6/2020,thesilverchef,"Sua Lor Prawn Aglio Olio, updated recipe of one of our favourite pasta dishes with a few improvements.

Start with 6 sua lor prawns from @lyhseafood for 2 persons. Deshell and devein the shrimp and separate them. Boil tagliatelle from @barilla for exactly 5 minutes and strain. Keep the pasta water.

In a pan of oil, lightly sauté the prawns on each side. Prawns cook very fast, so it will take only a minute or so to cook. Remove but use the same pan to cook the heads until they turn pink. Then add 2 ladles of pasta water and simmer for 5 minutes. Strain and keep the prawn stock.

In a pan, drizzle enough extra virgin olive oil to create a thin film of bathing oil. Add 2 cloves of thinly sliced garlic and 6 cherry tomatoes, halved. Let them bathe in the oil to make an aromatic garlic oil. Next add some chopped basil, be sure to keep another batch of same amount of basil for the finishing later.

Add a tbsp butter and let it monte the pan. In French cooking, monte usually comes at the end to make the sauce more rich and luxurious, but we are using butter to add flavour and richness. As the butter is melted, add the prawn stock to make the final sauce.

Once the sauce is boiling, add the pasta and quickly stir to get the pasta to absorb all the prawn and basil goodness. If you can toss the noodles, even better. The secret here is to make the pasta absorb the saucy liquid until it reduces to a creamy consistency.

To finish, turn off heat and add the prawns and the balance of basil and another tbsp of butter and monte or mantecare one last time. Stirring and tossing adds air to emulsify the butter into the sauce, giving it a rich creamy and glossy finish.

25/6/2020,thesilverchef,"Today is Dragon Boat Festival! Here is our recipe for this again in the event you are thinking of making this today.

Start by soaking 500g glutinous rice, 12 chestnuts and bamboo leaves overnight. Also, soak about 6 dried mushrooms for 2 hours.

Marinate 250g pork shoulder or belly with 1 tbsp light soya, 1 tbsp dark soya, 1 tbsp sesame oil, 1 tbsp oyster sauce, 3 minced garlic, 1 chopped shallot and some 5 spice powder. Add a dash of white pepper also.

In a wok of oil, fry 3 minced garlic and 1 chopped shallot until fragrant. Add the glutinous rice and mix well. Season with 1 tbsp light soya, 1 tbsp dark soya, 1 tbsp sesame oil, 1 tbsp oyster sauce and some 5 spice powder. Stir until the rice is evenly coated, then set aside and let it cool down.

In a fresh wok of oil, fry another 3 minced garlic, a handful of dried shrimp and 1 chopped shallot until fragrant. Add the marinated pork, dried mushrooms and chestnuts. Fry and stir until everything is properly mixed. After about 5 minutes, set aside and let it cool down.

For each dumping take 2 bamboo leaves and fold at the center to form a triangle cup as seen in the video. Spoon some rice to fill one third of the capacity. Add a chestnut and a piece of pork.

Then add a chestnut, half a mushroom, some braised peanuts (from can) and half a salted egg yolk. You can also add an abalone as an option.

Fold the the flap of the lead to cover the base of the dumpling and fold in any other flap. Ensure it is tight and there are no gaps to form a taut pyramid shape.

We tie the dumpling strings to a hangar, but you can improvise with whatever is convenient. Use the string to tie around the dumpling and ensure it is tight. Make 12 dumplings with this recipe.

Then boil the dumplings in a wok of water for 45 minutes and it should be done. If you didn’t leave any gaps, the dumpling should look firm and neat.

We still need more practice with our dumpling tying skills, but this way is certainly more affordable than buying commercial ones outside.

21/6/2020,thesilverchef,"Basting Steaks, using the lovely tenderloins from @thegoodmeatstore.

Here’s a quick recap on how to cook beautiful steaks with a golden brown crust and medium rare doneness.

First, you need to have a good cut - ribeye, striploin or tenderloin would be best. Avoid spending money on expensive Wagyu for this, an Aussie angus will do nicely.

Next, make sure your steak is at room temperature before you cook it, and pat dry on both sides so that there is no excess moisture. Then, season liberally with sea salt or course salt. Do likewise with black pepper.

The issue with most home cooked steaks is usually the pan is not hot enough, and you don’t get that golden crust. So make sure you heat up your pan with a shallow film of oil for a few minutes before you put the meat in.

You must get a beautiful sizzling sound when the beef hits the pan, and just leave it. You only need to turn once. After about 2 minutes, turn and you should get a nice golden brown crust. Add a tbsp butter and baste, which means using a spoon and quickly take some butter juice and pour over the top of the steak repeatedly as seen in the video. Cook for another 2 minutes.

For most ribeye and striploin cuts, the entire steak can usually cook in just the pan, but tenderloin and thicker cuts may need an extra time in the oven. If so, send the steak to the oven at 180 Celsius for another 2 to 3 minutes.

Once the steak is cooked to medium rare, you need to rest it for another 3 minutes or so. Make sure you don’t forget this as if not, your steak will not be as juicy. Once it’s properly rested, take a sharp knife and you should easily cut through the steak like butter.

You should get a ideal pink medium rare, and a juicy and tender texture. The basting will give it a lovely buttery beef flavour, and every bite should be nirvana for steak lovers :)))))",425,3,"['Drooling! 🤤', '❤️🔥👏😍Always looking so good!', 'Super! ❤️❤️❤️ Awesome cooking tips!']"

21/6/2020,thesilverchef,"Homemade Nasi Lemak.

Here’s our little take on this popular breakfast classic. It’s quite straightforward, just some effort to make the individual components.

First cook the coconut rice by adding some chopped pandan leaves, half cup of cream, 1 cup water to 1 cup of basmati rice. Normal rice will do also. Then let the rice cook until it’s done at normal rice cooker mode.

Fry some dried anchovies or ikan bilis in pan of oil until they are crispy delicious. Similarly, use the same pan to fry some raw peanuts until they are crispy on the outside too. Set both aside.

In a fresh pan with oil, sauté one sliced red onion until the onions are soft. Then add a few tbsp of sambal chilli or belachan. We happen to have our mum in law homemade one, and will share a recipe for this in a later post.

Fry until The onions and sambal are utterly aromatic. You can choose to add a few of the fried ikan bilis inside too. Add some tamarind juice and a tsp sugar and mix well. Once the juice has been reduced, your sambal paste is ready.

Cook a sunny side up egg as an accompaniment. Make sure only cook until the whites are set and leave the yolk creamy yolky.

To plate, simply pour some rice into a small bowl and flip it onto a plate or better, a banana leaf lined plate. Then simply add the egg on top of the rice, and the sambal, peanuts, ikan bilis and some sliced cucumbers by the side.

And it’s done! What we enjoy is the lovely lemak notes from the rice, beautifully contrasted with the kick of the sambal and the crunch of the ikan bilis and peanuts.

21/6/2020,thesilverchef,"A Doriyaki Hotdog.

Using the same Doriyaki pancake recipe, we did a simple hotdog using a Doriyaki pancake as a wrapper.

You need 80g plain flour, 40g sugar, honey, baking powder, 2 eggs, oil and water.

Make the batter first by adding the sugar into a bowl and add one tbsp honey. Break two eggs and whisk like there’s no tomorrow hehe. This is to introduce air into the mixture and after a few minutes, the mixture will start to foam and turn paler, and will have more liquid. This is a much better way to use your whisking muscles than to make some diabetic Korean kopi C which we will also never make here hehe.

Once the egg mixture is foamy and has a nice viscosity, add the 80g flour and half tsp baking powder and stir subtly until it foams into a nice yellow and eggy batter. Refrigerate for 15 minutes and after taking it out, add one tbsp plain water just to loosen the batter.

In a non stick pan, pour a ladle of egg batter into the centre and let it naturally spread out to form a round pancake shape. It will cook very quickly in a minute or two, so use a spatula to loosen the edges and get ready to flip.

Once it’s dry on the bottom side, quickly flip and cook the other side, which will tend to cook faster as the pan gets hotter.

Once done, simply wrap a pancake around a sausage of your choice and there you have it! A Doriyaki Hotdog :)))))",336,4,"['How cr', 'How creative 👍', '😱 never thought of this before!', '🤤😋']"

Then add 3 ladles of the prawn stock and use a pair of tongs to separate the noodle strands as they will be clumped together initially. If can, toss the wok as it will help the noodles to absorb the broth faster.

Once it gets dry, add more stock and repeat this for a few times until the noodles turn creamy and luscious. Then season with a tsp light soya, white pepper and as an optional, coriander powder or 5 spice powder.

Then add some leafy greens like the nai bai we using today and toss some more to cook  the vegetables quickly. Then turn off the flame, and add some oil or lard oil and black pepper. Give one final toss to emulsify the noodles into a shiny creamy noodley goodness.

In the cast iron pan, add one chopped garlic and sauté in oil until fragrant. Add 150g minced pork and mix well. Season with one tsp light soya and stir again.

Once the pork is sufficiently cooked, add some snow peas and let them boil inside the pan. Next, cut a rounded tofu packet from @fortunefoodmfgsg into thick discs and place them all around the pan and let them steam.

After a few minutes, add in two beaten eggs to form an omelette base at the bottom of the pan. Wait until the eggs are set, then add in the previously cooked crabmeat sauce. And you are done.

Sprinkle fresh black pepper and serve. We will simply eat directly from the cast iron pan as it makes a great hot plate sort of presentation.

Truth be told, we are never the biggest fans of chilli crab as most commercial ones use ketchup, and we prefer fresh sauces. So the next best thing is to do a chilli crab sauce with freshly made tagliatelle.

Blitz one shallot, 2 garlic and one chilli with some water in a blender until you get a nice moist paste. Then prepare the fresh pasta which is in our earlier post this morning.

Fry the chilli paste in a pan of oil until it’s amazingly aromatic. Then add a tsp of tau chui or fermented bean paste. If you don’t have this, just replace with a tsp salt or a tbsp light soya to give it savouriness.

Stir and mix well. Then add 5 tbsp tomato purée. You can use a few tbsp of ketchup to substitute but seriously, fresh tomato flavours are better. Stir well again.

Add a few ladles of unsalted stock or water and bring to a boil. Then add a tbsp of butter and stir until the butter melts. Sprinkle some coriander powder if available. Add in 150g of crabmeat or roughly a cup worth and let them all simmer for around 5 minutes.

As this is fresh pasta, we prefer to just blanche it right before putting in the pan of sauce. A quick boil of 20 seconds in boiling water will do, then immediately transfer to the pan of chilli crab sauce.

Mix well and toss and the saucy crab sauce will disappear into the pasta very quickly. Once it’s almost dry, turn off the flame and add in a tbsp of butter and give one final toss to get it utterly creamy. And you are done.

Simply twirl the pasta on a plate and garnish with some chopped scallion on top. It will be spicy creamy crabby delicious and prove to be highly addictive until the last strand :))))) Check out my profile story highlights for the full video snippets.",394,10,"['Looks so appetising', 'Looks soooo delicious 😍', ""I've been thinking abt doing this for a while, you just gave me a head up.

15/6/2020,thesilverchef,"Making fresh tagliatelle again today for a dinner dish later tonight. Here’s the fresh pasta recipe again.

Pour 2 cups of plain flour onto a table and make a well in the center. Crack 3 small eggs into the well and use a fork to whisk the eggs. Don’t worry if they leak out of the well, simply mix the flour with the egg mixture a shaggy wet dough starts to form.

Once enough flour and eggs are incorporated and it gets mode solid, start using your hands to knead the dough for about 6 minutes or so. You will end up with a drier smoother round ball dough after all the flour has been absorbed.

Cover with a cling wrap and let it rest for 20 minutes. After resting, place the dough ball back onto the table and cut into 2 equal halves. With each half, you can make a person worth portion of tagliatelle.

First flatten the halved dough with your palm into a pancake thick shape. Then use a rolling pin and start rolling out into a wider and thin sheet. You will know when it is thin enough when the sheet becomes slightly translucent and you can barely see through it to see the table underneath.

Then fold the bottom third in, then the top third over the other two thirds. Take a dough cutter or a knife, simply cut into tagliatelle sized noodles.

After that, simply spread and loosen the noodles. And let them rest for a few minutes before cooking them. Dust a bit more flour to prevent them from sticking.

To cook the pasta, simply salt the boiling water and let them cook for about 4 minutes and retain the starch from the pasta water to make a sauce :)))))",383,8,"['🍝 😋🙌', 'ooooh handcut 🍝']"

Start by making the pasta sheets. Pour 2 cups of plain flour onto a table and make a well in the center. Crack 3 small eggs into the well and use a fork to whisk the eggs.

Once enough flour and eggs are incorporated, start using your hands to knead the dough for about 6 minutes or so. You will end up with a drier smoother round ball dough after all the flour has been absorbed.

Cover with a cling wrap and let it rest for 20 minutes. After resting, place the dough ball back onto the table and cut into 2 equal halves. With each half, you can make one lasagne.

Use a rolling pin to roll out the pasta and measure with your baking dish to cut out 3 sheets that will cover each layer of lasagne.

You can use our previous Bolognese recipe for the filling, or simply use 2 packets of wagyu Bolognese from @shinsengrocer.

Make a bechamel sauce. Create a simple roux with one tbsp butter and 2 tsp plain flour in a saucepan. Turn on at low flame and slowly wipe the butter around flour filled pan to absorb all the flour.

You will end up with a yellow thick paste. Add fresh milk slowly and let it mix with the roux. The milk will quickly thicken up. Just keep adding until you get a sauce like consistency like what you see in the video. Add grated cheddar and parmesan. Season with black pepper.

Start layering the baking dish with a layer of Bolognese, followed by a pasta sheet. Boil the sheet for 10 seconds prior to placing in the dish. Then add mozzarella cheese and spoon enough bechamel sauce to cover the layer.

Then repeat the same meat, pasta, mozzarella and bechamel layer. For the last layer, add the meat and pasta sheet first. Then add the bechamel layer before adding the mozzarella and some parmesan.

Bake the lasagne in a preheated oven at 180 Celsius no fan for 45 minutes. Once it’s done baking, remove from oven and rest for 20 minutes before eating.

14/6/2020,thesilverchef,"Oxtail Stew.

You will need oxtails, one celery, one onion and one carrot are the basic ingredients. Red wine, one third can of cherry tomatoes, water and flour round up the rest.

Always brown your meat, in this case, oxtails in a cold pan under low heat. You don’t need oil as the beef has enough fat, and this will render the fat as well.

In a large pot, make a mirepoix, a fancy French word for 爆香, using diced onion, celery and carrot. Keep sautéing until they are soft and aromatic, hence the “Xiang” aspect. Add the seared oxtails into the pot and stir if you want to, though you don’t have to. Just look kinda chefy in case an immediate family is curiously looking on wondering what that gorgeous smell is.

Then add enough red wine. Now never ask a French cook how much, and I will never know, just add until you think it is enough. It is one of those things that it will have that magical wine notes at the end no matter what.

Now add enough water to cover the oxtails. If you have beef stock, better. But where to find beef bones to make stock, but if u do, I will be your best friend now.

Add a third of a can of cherry tomatoes, though plump ones will do as well. Try using Italian ones if possible, cos Italian produce just rocks.

That’s the hard part. Now all u need to do is bring everything to a boil, then lower it to simmering rolling boil. Which means the broth can see only one or two bubbles rolling away, and this is the ideal time to try the Iphone 11 slo mo video shot.

Be sure to check every half hour and top up water, don’t want this delicious dish to burn. I find watching Netflix sitcoms like Big Bang theory or modern family best for the intervals, or if u have an Apple Watch, set that timer which u never thought was useful.

Just an hour or less before that four hours cooking time, add 3 tbsp of plain flour to thicken the sauce and give it a nice glossy look.

Once 4 hours are up, and you have made it thru 8 episodes, plate and serve and enjoy this hearty tasty beef dish :))))) Check out my profile story highlights for the full video snippets",323,3,"['I love oxtail !

Indeed, the Simon Road uncle has been frying this for decades and it’s one of only 3 hkm which we frequent. His is the dry version which is, we feel, the right way to eat this classic. We hardly touch those super wet and moaty ones.

Fried noodle dishes need to absorb all the stock into the noodles so that the noodles are properly flavoured. That’s why we dislike the soupy ones as they tend to lack that perfect alchemy of flavours, and some can still taste the kee or lye taste of the yellow noodles.

Simon road uncle will always fry and braise the noodles until their tasty broth is fully incorporated, along with the rest of the egg and garlic fragrance, and tinged with a wok hei aroma, it’s quite sensational from first bite till last.

His son, Youri has been learning the ropes and has since picked up most of his dad frying skills, and trust us, it is something that takes time to get this good. Those who have tried our own rendition of hkm will appreciate the efforts just to prepare.

And combined with practice, this is one of our truly iconic Singaporean dishes. And that’s why we wholeheartedly endorse the Simon road stall.

11/6/2020,thesilverchef,"Teriyaki Confit Trout from @shinsengrocer.

One of the best ways to cook fish is using the confit method. It is essentially a gentle poach in flavoured oil that results in a very moist and tender flesh, and looks almost uncooked in a way.

Essentially the fish protein is cooked yet retains almost all the moisture and it will have a wondrous texture to the fish. Today we are using a teriyaki marinated trout from @shinsengrocer. As always, pat dry the fish prior to cooking.

Start by pouring enough oil to submerge the entire fish in a saucepan. Add a few sprigs of thyme, a few garlic cloves and some slices of lemon. Then heat it up slowly until it reaches 60 Celsius. You will need a kitchen thermometer to measure this.

Once it reaches 60 Celsius, put the trout inside the pan, and ensure the entire fish is covered in oil. Turn the heat to its lowest flame. The temperature should be maintained between 60 to 65 degrees during the cooking duration. Cook for 10 minutes.

Once the fish is cooked for 10 minutes, remove from the pan. As there is still sufficient teriyaki marinate left to make a sauce, we can use this.

Make a roux by adding one tbsp butter to 2 tsp plain flour in a clean saucepan. Let the butter absorb all the flour before slowly adding the teriyaki sauce and slowly stir until a saucy consistency is reached.

To serve, boil some nai bai as a side. Spoon some sauce at the bottom of the plate. Then add the nai bai, followed by the cooked trout. Quenelle some white truffle paste from @shinsengrocer and add some lemon zest on top to finish.

The joy of eating confit fish is the amazing texture, and you can cook thick red fish like salmon this way too. Enjoy :))))) Check out my profile story highlights for the full video snippets.",281,6,"['Beautiful 🤤', 'Do you re-use the oil?', '😘😋😘😋']"

This is so ridiculously easy to do at home, and will taste so good you wonder why you haven’t tried this earlier.

Start by slicing thinly 4 potatoes and 1 onion. Make a simple roux with one tbsp butter and 2 tsp plain flour in a saucepan. Turn on at low flame and slowly wipe the butter around flour filled pan to absorb all the flour.

You will end up with a yellow thick paste. Add fresh milk slowly and let it mix with the roux. The milk will quickly thicken up. Just keep adding until you get a sauce like consistency like what you see in the video. This is known as a bechamel sauce. Season with a tsp salt and black pepper and set aside.

In a baking dish, layer the onions first on the base of the dish. Then cover the onions fully with a layer of potatoes. Make sure it’s neatly packed.

Spoon the bechamel sauce over the potatoes, and make sure the sauce has fully covered the potatoes also. Then repeat another layer of onions, potatoes and bechamel sauce.

After pouring in the last of the sauce, and ensuring the potatoes are fully submerged in bechamel, sprinkle grated parmesan to fully cover the potato and sauce. We using parmigiana reggiano as it’s just so so good.

Then bake in the oven at 180 Celsius no fan for around 45 minutes. You should get a deliciously tempting golden crust and an accompanying gorgeous aroma to go along with it. If your potatoes are still not soft enough and you are afraid the crust will burn, simply cover the top with an aluminium foil.

11/6/2020,thesilverchef,"Red Bean Pancakes, here is the recipe again for those who missed it the first time.

You will need 50g rice flour, 50g plain flour, one egg white and 1 tsp salt. That’s about it, and a good non stick pan.

Mix the two flours, egg white and salt in a mixing bowl and whisk gently until you form a smooth batter.

In a non stick pan, do not oil the pan like most recipes suggest, we find it oil can break the crepe batter easily, but you do need practice in getting this part right. Do not turn on the flame at this point.

Use a ladle and spoon a ladle worth of batter and pour it in the center of the pan and tilt the pan until it fills up every corner, and making sure the batter is still thin enough. Try not to add additional batter in empty spots as this will make the crepe uneven.

Then turn on the flame at its lowest setting and slowly cook the crepe. Will take a few minutes for the batter to dry and the crepe to form. When it’s cooked, it will have a rubbery texture at the edges, use a thin spatula and gently roll and fold the crepe into an empty popiah. Then roll it off onto a plate.

Rinse the pan to cool down and repeat until your batter is finished. Then, with each crepe, add some red bean paste in the centre and fold at each of the 4 sides into a parcel, and flip over.

Now to deep fry. In a wok of boiling hot oil, gently slice each parcel into the oil and deep fry until golden brown, only a few minutes each side.

Remove when done and drain the pancakes of any excess oil and they are done! It should taste crispy and eggy, and delicious for an afternoon snack.

Today, we visit the south of Italy for one of the lesser known classics found here. Dispensing with cheese and pancetta, the main ingredients are olives, capers, anchovies and tomatoes, sun dried ones even better.

Start by boiling the linguine for about 6.5 minutes of the total 9 minutes cooking time. The remaining time will be finished in the sauce. We using our favourite @barilla brand as they consistently provide the best texture.

Strain the pasta and keep the pasta water. In a pan with a generous amount of extra virgin olive oil, sauté some anchovy fillets. These are not ikan bilis, but cured ones that are usually sold in bottles soaked in oil.

Add in thinly slice garlic, and thinly sliced as it will prevent it from burning too fast and allow the garlic oil to be nicely formed. Add in about 8 olives and a handful of capers. Stir and mix well.

Next, add one or 2 canned tomatoes and let the tomatoes soften. Add in a ladle of pasta water and stir. Throw in the linguine and quickly mix and toss if possible.

After a minute or so, the sauce will be absorbed into the pasta. Keep tossing until the water is almost gone. Then turn off the flame, and add in chopped parsley, black pepper and more extra virgin olive oil.

Give it one last good toss as this will allow the olive oil to emulsify with the liquid to give each strand of linguine a luscious and almost creamy feel.

Serve in a plate and enjoy this refreshing and healthier pasta :))))) Check out my profile story highlights for the full video snippets.",864,20,"['So yum 😋', '😋😋😋', '😍😍😍', 'Are both the capers n anchovies available at ntuc?😬🙏🏻', 'classic for a reason 🍝', 'quick n convenient ! thus the name 🙃🤭', '🤤🤤🤤', ""This is one of my son's faves.

Shakshuka in Arabic means a haphazard mixture, or in other words, a rojak to us. So feel free to replace the ingredients with whatever you have.

Ours begin with sauté sliced onions and carrots in a cast iron pan with oil until they are soft. We use cast iron as we can just bake the whole pan in the oven later.

Add broccoli, some sliced sausages and a couple of canned tomatoes and fry some more. Then season with half tsp salt, a dash of cumin, cayenne pepper and smoked paprika. Stir well.

Break 2 eggs into the pan or more if you like. Then simply bake in the oven at 180 Celsius for about 5 minutes. You just want to get the egg whites set but let the yolks remain creamy.

Once it’s done with the baking part, remove from oven. Break the yolks when you eat and mix it all around. It’s so good and hearty to start the day with :))))) Check out my profile story highlights for the full video snippets.",428,1,['Wow looks easy. Ok this weekend 🙌']
9/6/2020,thesilverchef,"Classic Jack Place Steak using Montreal Australia Marbled Steak from @shinsengrocer.

You will need a grill pan like the one in the video, though using a regular will do. You won’t get the lovely grill marks without the grill pan do.

The steak from @shinsengrocer comes pre seasoned so you just need to heat up the pan until it’s very hot before you add it in. As there is some fat on the beef, no oil is needed.

Steaks with this thickness usually take about 3 minutes to cook fully, so you should flip around the 1.5 minutes mark. As you need around that much time to get a nice crust and grill marks too, so the best doneness is medium pink.

Naturally we always hear from TV cooking shows that medium rare is the best doneness, but that’s for thicker cuts like thick striploin and tenderloin. Thinner cuts, we need to weigh getting better crusts for flavour against getting that medium rare texture.

We also didn’t baste the steak today as this is old school western Hainanese style we shooting for, so we added the slab of butter after we placed the cooked steak on a plate. Simply add the slab of butter on top of the steak.

As an added touch, we spooned some white truffle pate from @shinsengrocer as well, for that extra oomph. Garnish with some vegetables of your selection on the side.

When you eat, simply wipe that butter all over the steak before cutting into it. Yums :)))))",313,5,"['😘😋😘😋', 'This looks perfect 😍', 'Looks great!']"

Here’s a great way to cook fresh fish, especially when we still have this 2 week old seabass from @lyhseafood. And amazingly it still tastes fresher than most fish from supermarkets.

Blitz 4 garlic, 1 shallot, handful of dried shrimp, 1 lemongrass stalk, juice from half a big lime and 2 chillies until you form a paste.

Sauté one sliced onion in a pan of oil until soft and fragrant, and when they are, add in the spicy paste and mix well. Season with 1 tsp salt and add some water if it gets too dry.

On a baking tray lined with aluminium foil, place one complete banana leave on top as the base for this fish. You can get the leaves from @redmartcom.

Place your seabass or any white fish on top. You can use a fillet or if it’s big enough to fit on the leaf, an entire fish. Spread the cooked spicy paste on top of the fish.

Cover with another banana leaf and secure the sides and edges with toothpicks. Refer to the video for this. Then bake in an oven at 180 Celsius for about 15 minutes or so until the fish is fully cooked.

When it’s done, simply transfer to a serving plate and remove the toothpicks and top leaf. It should smell amazing and when you use a fork to pry open the fish, it should be tender, flaky and moist. And incredibly flavorful :))))) Check out my profile story highlights for the full video snippets.",371,13,"['Nice 😘😘😘', '😋so yummy!

9/6/2020,thesilverchef,"Here’s a recap of Doraemon favourite dessert, Doriyaki bean paste pancake sandwich.

You need 80g plain flour, 40g sugar, honey, baking powder, 2 eggs, oil and water.

Make the batter first by adding the sugar into a bowl and add one tbsp honey. Break two eggs and whisk like there’s no tomorrow hehe. This is to introduce air into the mixture and after a few minutes, the mixture will start to foam and turn paler, and will have more liquid. This is a much better way to use your whisking muscles than to make some diabetic Korean kopi C which we will also never make here hehe.

Once the egg mixture is foamy and has a nice viscosity, add the 80g flour and half tsp baking powder and stir subtly until it foams into a nice yellow and eggy batter. Refrigerate for 15 minutes and after taking it out, add one tbsp plain water just to loosen the batter.

We used our homemade red bean paste from a few days ago, but you can use pre-made ones as well. Add a little oil and stir well to smooth out the filling.

In a non stick pan, pour a ladle of egg batter into the centre and let it naturally spread out to form a round pancake shape. It will cook very quickly in a minute or two, so use a spatula to loosen the edges and get ready to flip.

Once it’s dry on the bottom side, quickly flip and cook the other side, which will tend to cook faster as the pan gets hotter. Make two pieces for each dorayaki sandwich. 
Once done, spoon some red bean filling on one piece and cover with another piece to form a sandwich. Use a cling wrap to tightly wrap around the dorayaki to get the chubby UFO shape. Leave for 10 minutes before unwrapping.

And there you have it, an aromatic eggy red bean or azuki Japanese pancake sandwich!

8/6/2020,thesilverchef,"Rice Cooker Dumplings, a ba zhang shortcut hack.

We have some balance of the rice dumpling filling from last week so decided to do a shortcut version for those who find it challenging to tie the actual ones.

Just a quick recap of the meat fillings - In a fresh wok of oil, fry another 3 minced garlic, a handful of dried shrimp and 1 chopped shallot until fragrant. Add the marinated pork, peanuts, dried mushrooms and chestnuts. Fry and stir until everything is properly mixed. After about 5 minutes, set aside and let it cool down. Soak one cup of glutinous rice overnight.

To a cup of water, add 1 tsp light soya, 1 tsp dark soya, 1 tsp oyster sauce, 1 tsp sesame oil and a dash of five spice powder. Stir well.

Add the soaked rice to a rice cooker and pour in the soya mixture and stir a bit. Let it cook in rice cooker until it’s fully cooked.

Put a cling wrap into a bowl to prevent sticking as glutinous rice is rather sticky. Spoon enough rice to cover one third of the bowl. Then add in the meat filling and fill the rest of the bowl with rice to cover.

On a plate, it’s optional to put a few bamboo leaves as this will rather give a more zhang vibe. Flip the bowl over onto the plate and gently lift at the sides and you should see a cutesy round shaped rice dumpling.

It should taste similar sans the boiled bamboo fragrance, though you can always boil the leaves too to get that aroma. :))))) Check out my profile story highlights for the full video snippets.",666,25,"['😋', 'Great 💕', 'You did not use glutinous rice?

25/6/2020,thesilverchef,"Today is Dragon Boat Festival! Here is our recipe for this again in the event you are thinking of making this today.

Start by soaking 500g glutinous rice, 12 chestnuts and bamboo leaves overnight. Also, soak about 6 dried mushrooms for 2 hours.

Marinate 250g pork shoulder or belly with 1 tbsp light soya, 1 tbsp dark soya, 1 tbsp sesame oil, 1 tbsp oyster sauce, 3 minced garlic, 1 chopped shallot and some 5 spice powder. Add a dash of white pepper also.

In a wok of oil, fry 3 minced garlic and 1 chopped shallot until fragrant. Add the glutinous rice and mix well. Season with 1 tbsp light soya, 1 tbsp dark soya, 1 tbsp sesame oil, 1 tbsp oyster sauce and some 5 spice powder. Stir until the rice is evenly coated, then set aside and let it cool down.

In a fresh wok of oil, fry another 3 minced garlic, a handful of dried shrimp and 1 chopped shallot until fragrant. Add the marinated pork, dried mushrooms and chestnuts. Fry and stir until everything is properly mixed. After about 5 minutes, set aside and let it cool down.

For each dumping take 2 bamboo leaves and fold at the center to form a triangle cup as seen in the video. Spoon some rice to fill one third of the capacity. Add a chestnut and a piece of pork.

Then add a chestnut, half a mushroom, some braised peanuts (from can) and half a salted egg yolk. You can also add an abalone as an option.

Fold the the flap of the lead to cover the base of the dumpling and fold in any other flap. Ensure it is tight and there are no gaps to form a taut pyramid shape.

We tie the dumpling strings to a hangar, but you can improvise with whatever is convenient. Use the string to tie around the dumpling and ensure it is tight. Make 12 dumplings with this recipe.

Then boil the dumplings in a wok of water for 45 minutes and it should be done. If you didn’t leave any gaps, the dumpling should look firm and neat.

We still need more practice with our dumpling tying skills, but this way is certainly more affordable than buying commercial ones outside.

21/6/2020,thesilverchef,"Basting Steaks, using the lovely tenderloins from @thegoodmeatstore.

Here’s a quick recap on how to cook beautiful steaks with a golden brown crust and medium rare doneness.

First, you need to have a good cut - ribeye, striploin or tenderloin would be best. Avoid spending money on expensive Wagyu for this, an Aussie angus will do nicely.

Next, make sure your steak is at room temperature before you cook it, and pat dry on both sides so that there is no excess moisture. Then, season liberally with sea salt or course salt. Do likewise with black pepper.

The issue with most home cooked steaks is usually the pan is not hot enough, and you don’t get that golden crust. So make sure you heat up your pan with a shallow film of oil for a few minutes before you put the meat in.

You must get a beautiful sizzling sound when the beef hits the pan, and just leave it. You only need to turn once. After about 2 minutes, turn and you should get a nice golden brown crust. Add a tbsp butter and baste, which means using a spoon and quickly take some butter juice and pour over the top of the steak repeatedly as seen in the video. Cook for another 2 minutes.

For most ribeye and striploin cuts, the entire steak can usually cook in just the pan, but tenderloin and thicker cuts may need an extra time in the oven. If so, send the steak to the oven at 180 Celsius for another 2 to 3 minutes.

Once the steak is cooked to medium rare, you need to rest it for another 3 minutes or so. Make sure you don’t forget this as if not, your steak will not be as juicy. Once it’s properly rested, take a sharp knife and you should easily cut through the steak like butter.

You should get a ideal pink medium rare, and a juicy and tender texture. The basting will give it a lovely buttery beef flavour, and every bite should be nirvana for steak lovers :)))))",425,3,"['Drooling! 🤤', '❤️🔥👏😍Always looking so good!', 'Super! ❤️❤️❤️ Awesome cooking tips!']"

Here’s our little take on this popular breakfast classic. It’s quite straightforward, just some effort to make the individual components.

First cook the coconut rice by adding some chopped pandan leaves, half cup of cream, 1 cup water to 1 cup of basmati rice. Normal rice will do also. Then let the rice cook until it’s done at normal rice cooker mode.

Fry some dried anchovies or ikan bilis in pan of oil until they are crispy delicious. Similarly, use the same pan to fry some raw peanuts until they are crispy on the outside too. Set both aside.

In a fresh pan with oil, sauté one sliced red onion until the onions are soft. Then add a few tbsp of sambal chilli or belachan. We happen to have our mum in law homemade one, and will share a recipe for this in a later post.

Fry until The onions and sambal are utterly aromatic. You can choose to add a few of the fried ikan bilis inside too. Add some tamarind juice and a tsp sugar and mix well. Once the juice has been reduced, your sambal paste is ready.

Cook a sunny side up egg as an accompaniment. Make sure only cook until the whites are set and leave the yolk creamy yolky.

To plate, simply pour some rice into a small bowl and flip it onto a plate or better, a banana leaf lined plate. Then simply add the egg on top of the rice, and the sambal, peanuts, ikan bilis and some sliced cucumbers by the side.

And it’s done! What we enjoy is the lovely lemak notes from the rice, beautifully contrasted with the kick of the sambal and the crunch of the ikan bilis and peanuts.

19/6/2020,thesilverchef,"Sua Lor Fried Noodles.

Some days it’s too cumbersome to do the full Hokkien Mee recipe, we decided to do a shortened version. We finally got our hands on sua lor prawns also from @lyhseafood and they make the best broth for this, and the meat is so crunchy and qq.

Deshell 14 prawns and fry the shells and heads in oil in a pot until they turn reddish pink and smells amazing. Then add water and simmer for at least 20 minutes.

Sauté the prawns themselves in a wok of oil for one minute each side and quickly remove them. In the same wok with the aromatic prawn oil, sauté a chopped garlic until its fragrant.

Then add some minced pork, we using the leftover xlb filling from @paradisegrpsg from lunch. Once the minced is cooked, add yellow noodles. We using the ones from @fortunefoodmfgsg.

Then add 3 ladles of the prawn stock and use a pair of tongs to separate the noodle strands as they will be clumped together initially. If can, toss the wok as it will help the noodles to absorb the broth faster.

Once it gets dry, add more stock and repeat this for a few times until the noodles turn creamy and luscious. Then season with a tsp light soya, white pepper and as an optional, coriander powder or 5 spice powder.

Then add some leafy greens like the nai bai we using today and toss some more to cook  the vegetables quickly. Then turn off the flame, and add some oil or lard oil and black pepper. Give one final toss to emulsify the noodles into a shiny creamy noodley goodness.

Then pour into a bowl and enjoy! We always like sua lor over the more sexy looking tiger prawns for flavour and texture :))))) Check out my profile story highlights for the full video snippets. #fortunecookschallenge",500,13,"['😋', 'Yummmmm', '😘😋😘😋', 'Oh it looks so so delicious!!!!', '🙋🏻\u200d♀️🙋🏻\u200d♀️🙋🏻\u200d♀️', '😋😋😋', 'Looks yummy !! 😍', '@unclesim']"

Now you can try your hand at making the same xlb you get at paradise dynasty, which happens to be our favourite xlb joint too.

Each kit comes with a set of wrappers, pork filling and a bamboo steamer similar to the ones at their restaurants. You can make up to 16 dumplings and this comes at a price of $23.80 which you can order directly from online platforms or as a takeaway.

As the wrappers are already made, all you need to do is just thaw the ingredients in advance and make each dumpling by hand. Spoon some filling into a wrapper and make 18 folds at the top. Pinch and close the dumpling and that’s it.

Make 8 different coloured ones as each steamer can hold up to 8 dumplings. Simply steam them for 7 minutes and it’s done! Easy. Just need to practice the folds though, as it needs a little of a nimble set of hands and some getting used to.

These are really affordable tenderloin steaks from @thegoodmeatstore and we are thoroughly impressed with the flavour and texture, and endorse this wholeheartedly.

Make the potato fondant by cutting a potato into a rectangular block and pan fry them in butter both sides for a few minutes each side. Then bake them in an oven at 180 Celsius no fan for 35 minutes.

Make a truffle soy by adding one tsp light soya, one tsp dark soya and some water in a saucepan and bring it to a boil. Then reduce by half it’s amount. Then slowly add small amounts of  unsalted cold butter and whisk until the butter melts.

Then repeat the process of adding and whisking butter until an emulsion is formed. Add few tsp of truffle pate from @shinsengrocer and black pepper.

Understandably, some of us are still apprehensive about venturing out to eat, especially this Dad day weekend, so we thought of showing you a few dishes you can do to celebrate this Sunday.

We got this lovely red emperor snapper from our favourite fish source, @lyhseafood and thought of doing the classic nanyang dish.

Prepare the tamarind juice by dissolving 2 tbsp tamarind water in a cup of water. Strain the juice free of the seeds and set aside.

Make the rempah paste by blitzing 4 garlic, 3 shallots, 1 lemongrass stalk, 1 fresh chilli, 1 dried chilli that have seeds removed and 1 block of belachan paste with some water.

In a wok of oil, fry off the rempah until the kitchen is abundant with belachan pungency, which will turn amazingly aromatic in time. Then break some kaffir lime leaves over the paste and add them into the mix.

Next, add a handful of chopped okra and one chopped tomato. Stir well. Then add the tamarind juice and another cup of water. Try not to buy those bottled tamarind juice as they won’t taste as good.

Bring everything to a boil and let it simmer for 5 minutes. Then add the red snapper fish cut into chunks. You can use any fish for that matter, but red snapper is just amazeballs here. Add some lemon juice and fresh parleys or Vietnamese mint.

Let the fish cook for around 10 minutes or until the meat is fully cooked. Then simply pour everything into a bowl and served with white rice. For a proper family celebration, you can pair with other dishes from some of our previous recipes.

Truth be told, we are never the biggest fans of chilli crab as most commercial ones use ketchup, and we prefer fresh sauces. So the next best thing is to do a chilli crab sauce with freshly made tagliatelle.

Blitz one shallot, 2 garlic and one chilli with some water in a blender until you get a nice moist paste. Then prepare the fresh pasta which is in our earlier post this morning.

Fry the chilli paste in a pan of oil until it’s amazingly aromatic. Then add a tsp of tau chui or fermented bean paste. If you don’t have this, just replace with a tsp salt or a tbsp light soya to give it savouriness.

Stir and mix well. Then add 5 tbsp tomato purée. You can use a few tbsp of ketchup to substitute but seriously, fresh tomato flavours are better. Stir well again.

Add a few ladles of unsalted stock or water and bring to a boil. Then add a tbsp of butter and stir until the butter melts. Sprinkle some coriander powder if available. Add in 150g of crabmeat or roughly a cup worth and let them all simmer for around 5 minutes.

As this is fresh pasta, we prefer to just blanche it right before putting in the pan of sauce. A quick boil of 20 seconds in boiling water will do, then immediately transfer to the pan of chilli crab sauce.

Mix well and toss and the saucy crab sauce will disappear into the pasta very quickly. Once it’s almost dry, turn off the flame and add in a tbsp of butter and give one final toss to get it utterly creamy. And you are done.

Simply twirl the pasta on a plate and garnish with some chopped scallion on top.

15/6/2020,thesilverchef,"Making fresh tagliatelle again today for a dinner dish later tonight. Here’s the fresh pasta recipe again.

Pour 2 cups of plain flour onto a table and make a well in the center. Crack 3 small eggs into the well and use a fork to whisk the eggs. Don’t worry if they leak out of the well, simply mix the flour with the egg mixture a shaggy wet dough starts to form.

Once enough flour and eggs are incorporated and it gets mode solid, start using your hands to knead the dough for about 6 minutes or so. You will end up with a drier smoother round ball dough after all the flour has been absorbed.

Cover with a cling wrap and let it rest for 20 minutes. After resting, place the dough ball back onto the table and cut into 2 equal halves. With each half, you can make a person worth portion of tagliatelle.

First flatten the halved dough with your palm into a pancake thick shape. Then use a rolling pin and start rolling out into a wider and thin sheet. You will know when it is thin enough when the sheet becomes slightly translucent and you can barely see through it to see the table underneath.

Then fold the bottom third in, then the top third over the other two thirds. Take a dough cutter or a knife, simply cut into tagliatelle sized noodles.

After that, simply spread and loosen the noodles. And let them rest for a few minutes before cooking them. Dust a bit more flour to prevent them from sticking.

Start by making the pasta sheets. Pour 2 cups of plain flour onto a table and make a well in the center. Crack 3 small eggs into the well and use a fork to whisk the eggs.

Once enough flour and eggs are incorporated, start using your hands to knead the dough for about 6 minutes or so. You will end up with a drier smoother round ball dough after all the flour has been absorbed.

Cover with a cling wrap and let it rest for 20 minutes. After resting, place the dough ball back onto the table and cut into 2 equal halves. With each half, you can make one lasagne.

Use a rolling pin to roll out the pasta and measure with your baking dish to cut out 3 sheets that will cover each layer of lasagne.

You can use our previous Bolognese recipe for the filling, or simply use 2 packets of wagyu Bolognese from @shinsengrocer.

Make a bechamel sauce. Create a simple roux with one tbsp butter and 2 tsp plain flour in a saucepan. Turn on at low flame and slowly wipe the butter around flour filled pan to absorb all the flour.

You will end up with a yellow thick paste. Add fresh milk slowly and let it mix with the roux. The milk will quickly thicken up. Just keep adding until you get a sauce like consistency like what you see in the video. Add grated cheddar and parmesan. Season with black pepper.

Start layering the baking dish with a layer of Bolognese, followed by a pasta sheet. Boil the sheet for 10 seconds prior to placing in the dish. Then add mozzarella cheese and spoon enough bechamel sauce to cover the layer.

Then repeat the same meat, pasta, mozzarella and bechamel layer. For the last layer, add the meat and pasta sheet first. Then add the bechamel layer before adding the mozzarella and some parmesan.

Bake the lasagne in a preheated oven at 180 Celsius no fan for 45 minutes. Once it’s done baking, remove from oven and rest for 20 minutes before eating.

14/6/2020,thesilverchef,"Oxtail Stew.

You will need oxtails, one celery, one onion and one carrot are the basic ingredients. Red wine, one third can of cherry tomatoes, water and flour round up the rest.

Always brown your meat, in this case, oxtails in a cold pan under low heat. You don’t need oil as the beef has enough fat, and this will render the fat as well.

In a large pot, make a mirepoix, a fancy French word for 爆香, using diced onion, celery and carrot. Keep sautéing until they are soft and aromatic, hence the “Xiang” aspect. Add the seared oxtails into the pot and stir if you want to, though you don’t have to. Just look kinda chefy in case an immediate family is curiously looking on wondering what that gorgeous smell is.

Then add enough red wine. Now never ask a French cook how much, and I will never know, just add until you think it is enough. It is one of those things that it will have that magical wine notes at the end no matter what.

Now add enough water to cover the oxtails. If you have beef stock, better. But where to find beef bones to make stock, but if u do, I will be your best friend now.

Add a third of a can of cherry tomatoes, though plump ones will do as well. Try using Italian ones if possible, cos Italian produce just rocks.

That’s the hard part. Now all u need to do is bring everything to a boil, then lower it to simmering rolling boil. Which means the broth can see only one or two bubbles rolling away, and this is the ideal time to try the Iphone 11 slo mo video shot.

Be sure to check every half hour and top up water, don’t want this delicious dish to burn. I find watching Netflix sitcoms like Big Bang theory or modern family best for the intervals, or if u have an Apple Watch, set that timer which u never thought was useful.

Just an hour or less before that four hours cooking time, add 3 tbsp of plain flour to thicken the sauce and give it a nice glossy look.

Indeed, the Simon Road uncle has been frying this for decades and it’s one of only 3 hkm which we frequent. His is the dry version which is, we feel, the right way to eat this classic. We hardly touch those super wet and moaty ones.

Fried noodle dishes need to absorb all the stock into the noodles so that the noodles are properly flavoured. That’s why we dislike the soupy ones as they tend to lack that perfect alchemy of flavours, and some can still taste the kee or lye taste of the yellow noodles.

Simon road uncle will always fry and braise the noodles until their tasty broth is fully incorporated, along with the rest of the egg and garlic fragrance, and tinged with a wok hei aroma, it’s quite sensational from first bite till last.

His son, Youri has been learning the ropes and has since picked up most of his dad frying skills, and trust us, it is something that takes time to get this good. Those who have tried our own rendition of hkm will appreciate the efforts just to prepare.

11/6/2020,thesilverchef,"Teriyaki Confit Trout from @shinsengrocer.

One of the best ways to cook fish is using the confit method. It is essentially a gentle poach in flavoured oil that results in a very moist and tender flesh, and looks almost uncooked in a way.

Essentially the fish protein is cooked yet retains almost all the moisture and it will have a wondrous texture to the fish. Today we are using a teriyaki marinated trout from @shinsengrocer. As always, pat dry the fish prior to cooking.

Start by pouring enough oil to submerge the entire fish in a saucepan. Add a few sprigs of thyme, a few garlic cloves and some slices of lemon. Then heat it up slowly until it reaches 60 Celsius. You will need a kitchen thermometer to measure this.

Once it reaches 60 Celsius, put the trout inside the pan, and ensure the entire fish is covered in oil. Turn the heat to its lowest flame. The temperature should be maintained between 60 to 65 degrees during the cooking duration. Cook for 10 minutes.

Once the fish is cooked for 10 minutes, remove from the pan. As there is still sufficient teriyaki marinate left to make a sauce, we can use this.

Make a roux by adding one tbsp butter to 2 tsp plain flour in a clean saucepan. Let the butter absorb all the flour before slowly adding the teriyaki sauce and slowly stir until a saucy consistency is reached.

To serve, boil some nai bai as a side. Spoon some sauce at the bottom of the plate. Then add the nai bai, followed by the cooked trout. Quenelle some white truffle paste from @shinsengrocer and add some lemon zest on top to finish.

The joy of eating confit fish is the amazing texture, and you can cook thick red fish like salmon this way too. Enjoy :))))) Check out my profile story highlights for the full video snippets.",281,6,"['Beautiful 🤤', 'Do you re-use the oil?', '😘😋😘😋']"
11/6/2020,thesilverchef,"Potato Gratin, a simple and delicious French classic.

This is so ridiculously easy to do at home, and will taste so good you wonder why you haven’t tried this earlier.

Start by slicing thinly 4 potatoes and 1 onion. Make a simple roux with one tbsp butter and 2 tsp plain flour in a saucepan. Turn on at low flame and slowly wipe the butter around flour filled pan to absorb all the flour.

You will end up with a yellow thick paste. Add fresh milk slowly and let it mix with the roux. The milk will quickly thicken up. Just keep adding until you get a sauce like consistency like what you see in the video. This is known as a bechamel sauce. Season with a tsp salt and black pepper and set aside.

In a baking dish, layer the onions first on the base of the dish. Then cover the onions fully with a layer of potatoes. Make sure it’s neatly packed.

Spoon the bechamel sauce over the potatoes, and make sure the sauce has fully covered the potatoes also. Then repeat another layer of onions, potatoes and bechamel sauce.

After pouring in the last of the sauce, and ensuring the potatoes are fully submerged in bechamel, sprinkle grated parmesan to fully cover the potato and sauce. We using parmigiana reggiano as it’s just so so good.

Then bake in the oven at 180 Celsius no fan for around 45 minutes. You should get a deliciously tempting golden crust and an accompanying gorgeous aroma to go along with it. If your potatoes are still not soft enough and you are afraid the crust will burn, simply cover the top with an aluminium foil.

Once it’s fully done, take it out and garnish with chopped parsley and fresh pepper. The inside should be creamy once the sauce has been reduced and the combination of potato, onion and meltingly crusty cheese should be undeniably additive :))))) Check out my profile story highlights for the full video snippets.",754,19,"['😍😍😍', 'Please, no onion but garlic.', 'What kind of potatoes will you recommend for this dish pls?', ""The recipe doesn't need bechamel only cream,patatoes and slide garlic."", 'How much fresh milk to thicken the sauce ?

11/6/2020,thesilverchef,"Red Bean Pancakes, here is the recipe again for those who missed it the first time.

You will need 50g rice flour, 50g plain flour, one egg white and 1 tsp salt. That’s about it, and a good non stick pan.

Mix the two flours, egg white and salt in a mixing bowl and whisk gently until you form a smooth batter.

In a non stick pan, do not oil the pan like most recipes suggest, we find it oil can break the crepe batter easily, but you do need practice in getting this part right. Do not turn on the flame at this point.

Use a ladle and spoon a ladle worth of batter and pour it in the center of the pan and tilt the pan until it fills up every corner, and making sure the batter is still thin enough. Try not to add additional batter in empty spots as this will make the crepe uneven.

Then turn on the flame at its lowest setting and slowly cook the crepe. Will take a few minutes for the batter to dry and the crepe to form. When it’s cooked, it will have a rubbery texture at the edges, use a thin spatula and gently roll and fold the crepe into an empty popiah. Then roll it off onto a plate.

Rinse the pan to cool down and repeat until your batter is finished. Then, with each crepe, add some red bean paste in the centre and fold at each of the 4 sides into a parcel, and flip over.

Now to deep fry. In a wok of boiling hot oil, gently slice each parcel into the oil and deep fry until golden brown, only a few minutes each side.

Remove when done and drain the pancakes of any excess oil and they are done! It should taste crispy and eggy, and delicious for an afternoon snack.

10/6/2020,thesilverchef,"Puttanesca Linguine, an Italian classic pasta recalling the Mediterranean.

Today, we visit the south of Italy for one of the lesser known classics found here. Dispensing with cheese and pancetta, the main ingredients are olives, capers, anchovies and tomatoes, sun dried ones even better.

Start by boiling the linguine for about 6.5 minutes of the total 9 minutes cooking time. The remaining time will be finished in the sauce. We using our favourite @barilla brand as they consistently provide the best texture.

Strain the pasta and keep the pasta water. In a pan with a generous amount of extra virgin olive oil, sauté some anchovy fillets. These are not ikan bilis, but cured ones that are usually sold in bottles soaked in oil.

Add in thinly slice garlic, and thinly sliced as it will prevent it from burning too fast and allow the garlic oil to be nicely formed. Add in about 8 olives and a handful of capers. Stir and mix well.

Next, add one or 2 canned tomatoes and let the tomatoes soften. Add in a ladle of pasta water and stir. Throw in the linguine and quickly mix and toss if possible.

After a minute or so, the sauce will be absorbed into the pasta. Keep tossing until the water is almost gone. Then turn off the flame, and add in chopped parsley, black pepper and more extra virgin olive oil.

Give it one last good toss as this will allow the olive oil to emulsify with the liquid to give each strand of linguine a luscious and almost creamy feel.

Break 2 eggs into the pan or more if you like. Then simply bake in the oven at 180 Celsius for about 5 minutes. You just want to get the egg whites set but let the yolks remain creamy.

9/6/2020,thesilverchef,"Classic Jack Place Steak using Montreal Australia Marbled Steak from @shinsengrocer.

You will need a grill pan like the one in the video, though using a regular will do. You won’t get the lovely grill marks without the grill pan do.

The steak from @shinsengrocer comes pre seasoned so you just need to heat up the pan until it’s very hot before you add it in. As there is some fat on the beef, no oil is needed.

Steaks with this thickness usually take about 3 minutes to cook fully, so you should flip around the 1.5 minutes mark. As you need around that much time to get a nice crust and grill marks too, so the best doneness is medium pink.

Naturally we always hear from TV cooking shows that medium rare is the best doneness, but that’s for thicker cuts like thick striploin and tenderloin. Thinner cuts, we need to weigh getting better crusts for flavour against getting that medium rare texture.

We also didn’t baste the steak today as this is old school western Hainanese style we shooting for, so we added the slab of butter after we placed the cooked steak on a plate. Simply add the slab of butter on top of the steak.

As an added touch, we spooned some white truffle pate from @shinsengrocer as well, for that extra oomph. Garnish with some vegetables of your selection on the side.

When you eat, simply wipe that butter all over the steak before cutting into it. Yums :)))))",313,5,"['😘😋😘😋', 'This looks perfect 😍', 'Looks great!']"

On a baking tray lined with aluminium foil, place one complete banana leave on top as the base for this fish. You can get the leaves from @redmartcom.

Place your seabass or any white fish on top. You can use a fillet or if it’s big enough to fit on the leaf, an entire fish. Spread the cooked spicy paste on top of the fish.

Cover with another banana leaf and secure the sides and edges with toothpicks. Refer to the video for this. Then bake in an oven at 180 Celsius for about 15 minutes or so until the fish is fully cooked.

When it’s done, simply transfer to a serving plate and remove the toothpicks and top leaf. It should smell amazing and when you use a fork to pry open the fish, it should be tender, flaky and moist.

You need 80g plain flour, 40g sugar, honey, baking powder, 2 eggs, oil and water.

Make the batter first by adding the sugar into a bowl and add one tbsp honey. Break two eggs and whisk like there’s no tomorrow hehe. This is to introduce air into the mixture and after a few minutes, the mixture will start to foam and turn paler, and will have more liquid. This is a much better way to use your whisking muscles than to make some diabetic Korean kopi C which we will also never make here hehe.

Once the egg mixture is foamy and has a nice viscosity, add the 80g flour and half tsp baking powder and stir subtly until it foams into a nice yellow and eggy batter. Refrigerate for 15 minutes and after taking it out, add one tbsp plain water just to loosen the batter.

We used our homemade red bean paste from a few days ago, but you can use pre-made ones as well. Add a little oil and stir well to smooth out the filling.

In a non stick pan, pour a ladle of egg batter into the centre and let it naturally spread out to form a round pancake shape. It will cook very quickly in a minute or two, so use a spatula to loosen the edges and get ready to flip.

Once it’s dry on the bottom side, quickly flip and cook the other side, which will tend to cook faster as the pan gets hotter. Make two pieces for each dorayaki sandwich. 
Once done, spoon some red bean filling on one piece and cover with another piece to form a sandwich. Use a cling wrap to tightly wrap around the dorayaki to get the chubby UFO shape. Leave for 10 minutes before unwrapping.

We have some balance of the rice dumpling filling from last week so decided to do a shortcut version for those who find it challenging to tie the actual ones.

Just a quick recap of the meat fillings - In a fresh wok of oil, fry another 3 minced garlic, a handful of dried shrimp and 1 chopped shallot until fragrant. Add the marinated pork, peanuts, dried mushrooms and chestnuts. Fry and stir until everything is properly mixed. After about 5 minutes, set aside and let it cool down.

To a cup of water, add 1 tsp light soya, 1 tsp dark soya, 1 tsp oyster sauce, 1 tsp sesame oil and a dash of five spice powder. Stir well.

Add the soaked rice to a rice cooker and pour in the soya mixture and stir a bit. Let it cook in rice cooker until it’s fully cooked.

Put a cling wrap into a bowl to prevent sticking as glutinous rice is rather sticky. Spoon enough rice to cover one third of the bowl. Then add in the meat filling and fill the rest of the bowl with rice to cover.

On a plate, it’s optional to put a few bamboo leaves as this will rather give a more zhang vibe. Flip the bowl over onto the plate and gently lift at the sides and you should see a cutesy round shaped rice dumpling.

Here’s how to do this at home, you need to have kimchi of course, which you can easily procure at the local supermarkets. And as an optional extra, we are using smoked bratwurst though bacon or luncheon meat will do just as well.

Have some cooked rice ready, and contrary to popular belief, you don’t need to use overnight rice. What you can do is to cook the rice a few hours in advance, and once it’s cook, open the lid and let it dry out for an hour to 2. The key is to remove any excess moisture so that the rice won’t be clumpy when fried.

Start in a wok with some oil and fry the meat chopped in small dices. Fry a few minutes until it’s lightly browned. If your kimchi is still in large pieces, make sure to cut them into smaller and thinner slices beforehand.

Add the kimchi, as to how much it’s up to you. We would suggest about 2 handfuls should be sufficient but go crazy with more if you adore the Korean pickled cabbage.

Stir and mix well with the meat. We add a canned tomato and some of the juices to give it some hearty acidity, but you can substitute with Korean gochujang sauce for an extra spicy kick.

Next add the rice and stir well. Use a spatula to break up any clumpy rice and get every grain properly coated with the kimchi sauce. It should look bright red when it’s done. 
Add a dash of sesame oil and chopped scallion. Turn off the flame and serve. We are using a shallow cast iron pan as it resembles those metal pans that Korean places usually use.

For garnishing, cut a dried seaweed sheet into very thin strips and place in the center of the rice. Then sprinkle some white sesame seeds and you are done! And just to make it more Korean, stick 2 long spoons at opposite sides of the pan.

Add a sunny side egg as an extra and enjoy the simple but highly tasty fried rice :))))) Check out my profile story highlights for the full video snippets.

Once you get that wet dough, pour it out onto a flour dusted table. Then knead until you form a smooth dough ball. Cover with a damp cloth and let it rest in a warm place for about 2 hours.

After resting, cut the dough into halves. Each half will make one pizza base. Shape each dough into another dough ball and then rest for another 2 hours.

After the dough ball has rested enough, place it on a flour dusted table again. Punch it down with your fist to flatten it. Then spread it out as much as you can. You can hold it in the air with both hands and just roll it like you see in the video.

Once it’s thin enough and it’s the size of a regular pizza shape, place the dough on a round baking pan. Add four different cheeses, we chose parmigiana reggiano, cheddar, mozzarella and gruyere cheese.

In addition, we soaked some dry porcini for half an hour and placed the soak porcini around the pizza, and drizzled some of the porcini water around too. To make it even more luxurious, we added some truffle paste from @shinsengrocer.

Bake it in a preheated oven at 250 Celsius or at your highest available temperature for 8 to 10 minutes. When the cheese has completely melted and has a light golden crust, remove from oven.

It should look like golden brown cheese nirvana and the lovely aroma of melted cheese and porcini, and should be delicious to cheese lovers everywhere :)))))",365,4,"['😋😋', 'My favourite 🤩']"

Here’s how you can assemble your own wagyu don at home without breaking the bank. We happen to have some excellent beef short ribs from @yakiniku_plaza.

Cook some white rice. In a pan of oil, fry half an onion that has been sliced. Fry until they are soft and translucent. Once they are caramelised, they will be gorgeously sweet. Season with a tbsp light soya and one tbsp mirin. Set aside.

You can use any beef shabu for this also, but it’s better to get a thicker cut ones. The better the quality the beef, the better this rice bowl will turn out.

Season with just some sea salt and black pepper. At home, it’s hard to replicate a proper charcoal fire yakiniku experience, so we settled for a grill pan. Though any pan will do, just that you can get nice grill marks from a grill pan.

Get the pan nice and hot, and simply cook it for a minute or less each side. Don’t add  oil especially for wagyu cuts as they have enough fat on it’s own, and don’t overcook. Beef this thin and good, you want to preserve the tender moist texture and flavours.

Once the beef is cooked, time to plate up. In a bowl of rice, layer the caramelised onions first, followed by placing the beef slices around the onions to form a mountain shape. See the video for this.

Then just add some more onions and garnish with either scallions or leeks. Sprinkle some furikake for that complete Japanese feel and voila, Mount Karubi Don is born :))))) Check out my profile story highlights for the full video snippets.",520,5,"['❤️❤️❤️', ""May I know what's the brand of ur grill pan?""]"

Get thick toasts for this though any normal white bread can still work. We using our homemade Hokkaido milk bread which is even more delicious.

First, trim off the crust edges. Use 2 slices for each hk toast. Spread smooth peanut butter on both slices, we using the healthy almond one from @scoopwholefoods_sg. Cover and make the egg coating.

Add 3 tbsp of fresh milk to 3 eggs and beat them well. Use a wide enough plate or pan that can hold the width of your toast. Get your oil hot and ready first before you coat as this is crucial.

Use a pot wide enough to hold the toast and allow it to turn on its sides. Heat up the oil to 150 Celsius. To test, drop a few drops of the egg coat and it should sizzle and fry into a batter almost instantly.

Set the stove to medium heat. Coat the toast with the egg solution on every side evenly. Each side only a few seconds as the idea is not to let it soak too much for too long. Once it’s all coated, immediately drop it into the pot of bubbling oil.

Each side should only take 30 seconds to get brown. You should get crusty fried egg shards on the sides, this will be so delicious! Use tongs to flip to the edges to get all 6 sides fully fried. On the last side, which should be the other flat side, set heat to maximum to get full deep fry mode. This will allow the toast not to get too much excess oil.

Drain the toast on paper towels to remove any last bit of oil. To finish, add a thick slice of cold butter and drizzle cold maple syrup on top and you are down! It may be called French toast, and as much as I regard French cooking, this is one thing that Asians are much better at pulling off :))))) Check out my profile story highlights for the full video snippets.",626,7,"['Agree ❤️', 'Yummy.. peanut butter in the middle is a game changer', '@hellosam8', 'Going to do this today! 好味😋', 'Yummy 😍', '❤️❤️❤️']"

Dragon Boat Festival is just around the corner and with saving costs foremost on our minds, we decided to make our own instead of buying from outside.

Start by soaking 500g glutinous rice, 12 chestnuts and bamboo leaves overnight. Also, soak about 6 dried mushrooms for 2 hours.

Marinate 250g pork shoulder or belly with 1 tbsp light soya, 1 tbsp dark soya, 1 tbsp sesame oil, 1 tbsp oyster sauce, 3 minced garlic, 1 chopped shallot and some 5 spice powder. Add a dash of white pepper also.

In a wok of oil, fry 3 minced garlic and 1 chopped shallot until fragrant. Add the glutinous rice and mix well. Season with 1 tbsp light soya, 1 tbsp dark soya, 1 tbsp sesame oil, 1 tbsp oyster sauce and some 5 spice powder. Stir until the rice is evenly coated, then set aside and let it cool down.

In a fresh wok of oil, fry another 3 minced garlic, a handful of dried shrimp and 1 chopped shallot until fragrant. Add the marinated pork, dried mushrooms and chestnuts. Fry and stir until everything is properly mixed. After about 5 minutes, set aside and let it cool down.

For each dumping take 2 bamboo leaves and fold at the center to form a triangle cup as seen in the video. Spoon some rice to fill one third of the capacity. Add a chestnut and a piece of pork.

Then add a chestnut, half a mushroom, some braised peanuts (from can) and half a salted egg yolk. You can also add an abalone as an option.

Fold the the flap of the lead to cover the base of the dumpling and fold in any other flap. Ensure it is tight and there are no gaps to form a taut pyramid shape.

We tie the dumpling strings to a hangar, but you can improvise with whatever is convenient. Use the string to tie around the dumpling and ensure it is tight. Make 12 dumplings with this recipe.

Then boil the dumplings in a wok of water for 45 minutes and it should be done. If you didn’t leave any gaps, the dumpling should look firm and neat.

We often find this dish in Thai eateries, here’s how to make this simple dish at home. Gaprao is Thai for holy basil, which is different from the Italian basil we see in pasta. It has a more minty herbaceous aroma.

Start by making the sauce by adding together, 1 tbsp fish sauce, 1 tbsp light soya, 1 tbsp dark soya, 1 tbsp oyster sauce and 2 tbsp water. Optional add tbsp sugar. Mix well and set aside.

In a wok of hot oil, fry 2 minced garlic and 1 finely chopped chilli until they are fragrant. Add 200g to 250g minced pork and stir. Make sure to use a spatula to break out the meat to avoid clumps.

Once the meat has sufficiently browned, add the sauce and mix well until the meat is fully coated. Then add half a chopped onion and a handful of chopped long beans. Mix well again.

When the onions and long beans are soft, turn off the flame and add in a handful of Thai basil leaves. Toss quickly in the residual heat to somewhat blanche the basil. And that’s it, easy.

2/6/2020,thesilverchef,"Crispy Salmon, how to get it right.

Always pat dry your salmon before cooking it, and make sure it’s at room temperature. So, don’t take it out from the refrigerator too late.

Season with sea salt is best, as the courser particles will not dissolve that fast and make it overly salty. Season liberally also with both salt and black pepper on both sides. Salt will also help to extract any additional moisture, and that will help in making the skin crispy.

In a pan with a generous amount of oil at medium heat, always make sure the pan is well heated up before putting the fish in. And always start with skin side down, and a good non stick pan is best.

Slide the pan a bit to maw sure the skin is not sticking to the pan, and also only to turn the fish once. Fish like salmon only takes 4 to 5 minutes at most. Which means it should take not more than 2.5 minutes for each side, which is sufficient to crisp up the skin.

Once the skin side is crispy, flip the fish over and drop a spoon of butter which will melt very quickly. Use a spoon to baste the fish like what you see in the video.

Use a pair of tongs to feel the sides of the fish. It should feel firmer than when it was raw, but not too tough until it’s hard. Once you get that nice firm and toi toi texture, remove the fish from the heat and let it rest for a few minutes.

Your salmon skin will also dry off and you will end up with a perfectly seared and crispy skin, and a flaky and slightly pink and moist, tender flesh inside :))))) Check out my profile story highlights for the full video snippets.",1200,20,"['Love it!

Turn the heat to low and add in one beaten egg and cover with lid for about 10 seconds. Open the lid and wait for the base of the egg to set and see that the egg is not watery. If it’s just moist, it will be fine as the egg will continue to cook on its own residual heat.

Butter both slices of a bread, we doing this with our own Hokkaido milk bread yields the best result. We use ghee here cos it’s clarified and mighty delicious, especially with our local QBB green tin brand.

In a pan of oil at low to medium heat, put both slices in simultaneously, buttered side faced down. Rub a little of the oil to prevent sticking. Immediately add the cheeses. We chose gouda, emental, cheddar and mozzarella, but you can go crazy with your own combinations.

After about a minute, cover your cheeses with the other slice and butter the top of it again with more butter. Yes, butter is marvelous here as it gives tremendous flavor. Then after another minute, flip over and toast the other side good.

Then after another minute, your cheeses should melt nicely. Now, if your bread is a bit thick like ours, do not fret if the cheese takes longer to melt. Simply send to the oven at 220 Celsius and toast for another 5 minutes with a foil wrap to get that final melting done.

Once the cheese has melted, then comes the really fun part. Cut into half and hear that symphony of crust crackling. Then, pull them apart for that cheesy stretch effect, fantastic for that instagram video.

After a good mix, roll out the mixed granola onto a baking tray lined with baking paper. Spread it out evenly to cover every corner. Then send it to the oven for 15 minutes at 180 Celsius at no fan mode. Every five minutes, just stir it around to prevent any burning.

Once it’s nicely toasted, take it out of the oven and add some dried sultana, freeze dried strawberries and cacao nibs to complete this crunchy and nutritious granola.

30/5/2020,thesilverchef,"Crispy Salmon in Vegetable Broth.

Thanks to our friends at @greenies.sg, we had a bounty of vegetables and fruits today, and what’s fun about them is they also cut some of these veggies for you, making it easier to work with.

And the first thing we thought of to maximize such nice vegetables was to make a delicious vegetable broth to go with a crispy pan seared salmon. We will show the salmon searing technique separately so watch for this in a later post.

To make the stock, simply put in a slow cooker, a chopped onion, a few stalks of chopped celery, one chopped carrot and some white cabbage. Add water to fill up the pot and set to slow cook for at least 8 hours. You can do this in pot over a stove also, just be mindful to top up water every once in a while.

We will not eat or use the vegetables in the slow cooker. The veggies we use in the actual dish will be roasted instead, as they taste amazingly tasty sweet when you cook them this way.

Slice the vegetables very thinly so you can roast them quickly without burning them. Lay these potatoes neatly on a baking tray lined with aluminum foil. Potatoes, carrots, celery, broccoli and beetroot.

Season them with sea salt and drizzle with olive oil. Roast in the oven at 200 Celsius for between 10 to 12 minutes until they are soft enough. Be mindful not to cook them too long as they will burn.

Cook the salmon. To plate, simply place the roasted vegetables in a nice fashion like what is seen in the video. Place the salmon on top. Then use a serving pot to pour in the broth like how they do it in a fine dining restaurant. The beetroot will also slowly give the broth a bright Ferrari red colour. And voila, a beautiful delicious salmon in vegetables broth dish.

This way, we can still enjoy a really fine dining dish at home :))))) Check out my profile story highlights for the full video snippets, and wait for the separate salmon video later.",461,4,"['That skin looks🔥', 'Yummmm😋😋😋', '😘😘😘']"

Soak 100g of glutinous rice for 2 hours. Also soak 2 dried Chinese mushrooms for an hour and retain the mushroom water. Boil a lup cheong or Chinese sausage for a minute to help to remove the skin easily.

Dice the sausage, along with a clove of garlic. In a wok of oil, dry the garlic, sausage and a handful of dried shrimp until it’s temptingly aromatic.

Then add the glutinous rice and mix well. Season with 1 tsp light soya, 1 tsp dark soya, 1 tsp sesame oil, 1 tsp Chinese wine and some white pepper. Stir well.

Spoon the rice into each squid and make sure they are evenly distributed along the length of the squid body. Do not stuff too tightly also as the squid will shrink, just ensure there’s enough ratio of rice to squid inside.

Sprinkle some chopped scallion and garlic. Drizzle a simple sauce comprising of 3 tsp water, 1 tsp light soya, 1/2 tsp sesame oil and 1/2 tsp Chinese wine. Then steam the squid for 4 or 5 minutes as squid cooks very fast.

8/6/2020,thesilverchef,"Rice Cooker Dumplings, a ba zhang shortcut hack.

We have some balance of the rice dumpling filling from last week so decided to do a shortcut version for those who find it challenging to tie the actual ones.

Just a quick recap of the meat fillings - In a fresh wok of oil, fry another 3 minced garlic, a handful of dried shrimp and 1 chopped shallot until fragrant. Add the marinated pork, peanuts, dried mushrooms and chestnuts. Fry and stir until everything is properly mixed. After about 5 minutes, set aside and let it cool down. Soak one cup of glutinous rice overnight.

To a cup of water, add 1 tsp light soya, 1 tsp dark soya, 1 tsp oyster sauce, 1 tsp sesame oil and a dash of five spice powder. Stir well.

Add the soaked rice to a rice cooker and pour in the soya mixture and stir a bit. Let it cook in rice cooker until it’s fully cooked.

Put a cling wrap into a bowl to prevent sticking as glutinous rice is rather sticky. Spoon enough rice to cover one third of the bowl. Then add in the meat filling and fill the rest of the bowl with rice to cover.

On a plate, it’s optional to put a few bamboo leaves as this will rather give a more zhang vibe. Flip the bowl over onto the plate and gently lift at the sides and you should see a cutesy round shaped rice dumpling.

It should taste similar sans the boiled bamboo fragrance, though you can always boil the leaves too to get that aroma. :))))) Check out my profile story highlights for the full video snippets.",666,25,"['😋', 'Great 💕', 'You did not use glutinous rice?

7/6/2020,thesilverchef,"Kimchi Fried Rice, easy and delicious.

Here’s how to do this at home, you need to have kimchi of course, which you can easily procure at the local supermarkets. And as an optional extra, we are using smoked bratwurst though bacon or luncheon meat will do just as well.

Have some cooked rice ready, and contrary to popular belief, you don’t need to use overnight rice. What you can do is to cook the rice a few hours in advance, and once it’s cook, open the lid and let it dry out for an hour to 2. The key is to remove any excess moisture so that the rice won’t be clumpy when fried.

Start in a wok with some oil and fry the meat chopped in small dices. Fry a few minutes until it’s lightly browned. If your kimchi is still in large pieces, make sure to cut them into smaller and thinner slices beforehand.

Add the kimchi, as to how much it’s up to you. We would suggest about 2 handfuls should be sufficient but go crazy with more if you adore the Korean pickled cabbage.

Stir and mix well with the meat. We add a canned tomato and some of the juices to give it some hearty acidity, but you can substitute with Korean gochujang sauce for an extra spicy kick.

Next add the rice and stir well. Use a spatula to break up any clumpy rice and get every grain properly coated with the kimchi sauce. It should look bright red when it’s done. 
Add a dash of sesame oil and chopped scallion. Turn off the flame and serve. We are using a shallow cast iron pan as it resembles those metal pans that Korean places usually use.

For garnishing, cut a dried seaweed sheet into very thin strips and place in the center of the rice. Then sprinkle some white sesame seeds and you are done! And just to make it more Korean, stick 2 long spoons at opposite sides of the pan.

Add a sunny side egg as an extra and enjoy the simple but highly tasty fried rice :))))) Check out my profile story highlights for the full video snippets.

Start by opening a packet of grated coconut, which you can get from @redmartcom. Break it into pieces as it’s probably quite hardened when you open. Add half tsp salt. Steam the coconut on a plate in a wok for about 15 minutes. Set aside for later.

Cut about 12 pandan leaves into shorter lengths and add them to a blender with about 100ml water. Blitz until you get pandan juice. Strain the juice. Chop palm sugar or gula melaka into small chunks. You can buy this from @redmartcom also.

Then tear the dough into roughly 20g sized pieces, each making one Ondeh ball. Flatten it and add a piece of palm sugar and fold until you cover the sugar. Roll into a round ball. You should be able to make a dozen balls.

Boil a pot of water and add the balls into the bubbling water. It will initially sink to the bottom of the pot. It will need between 10 to 15 minutes to fully cook the Ondeh balls.

Around 10 mins or so, the balls will start to float up. Let it cook another 2 to 5 minutes to allow the gula melaka to fully melt inside. Once it’s cooked, strain the balls of excess water.

Using the same pizza recipe from the original margherita pizza from a few days back, we replaced the tomato filling with a gorgeous four cheese and porcini one. Here’s a recap of the dough recipe.

Dissolve 1 tsp instant yeast to 160ml warm water. In a mixing bowl, add 250g plain flour and 1/2 tsp salt. Stir to mix well. Then slowly add the yeast mixture into the flour until they are fully integrated. Stir to form a shaggy dough.

Once you get that wet dough, pour it out onto a flour dusted table. Then knead until you form a smooth dough ball. Cover with a damp cloth and let it rest in a warm place for about 2 hours.

After resting, cut the dough into halves. Each half will make one pizza base. Shape each dough into another dough ball and then rest for another 2 hours.

After the dough ball has rested enough, place it on a flour dusted table again. Punch it down with your fist to flatten it. Then spread it out as much as you can. You can hold it in the air with both hands and just roll it like you see in the video.

Once it’s thin enough and it’s the size of a regular pizza shape, place the dough on a round baking pan. Add four different cheeses, we chose parmigiana reggiano, cheddar, mozzarella and gruyere cheese.

In addition, we soaked some dry porcini for half an hour and placed the soak porcini around the pizza, and drizzled some of the porcini water around too. To make it even more luxurious, we added some truffle paste from @shinsengrocer.

Bake it in a preheated oven at 250 Celsius or at your highest available temperature for 8 to 10 minutes. When the cheese has completely melted and has a light golden crust, remove from oven.

Here’s how you can assemble your own wagyu don at home without breaking the bank. We happen to have some excellent beef short ribs from @yakiniku_plaza.

Cook some white rice. In a pan of oil, fry half an onion that has been sliced. Fry until they are soft and translucent. Once they are caramelised, they will be gorgeously sweet. Season with a tbsp light soya and one tbsp mirin. Set aside.

You can use any beef shabu for this also, but it’s better to get a thicker cut ones. The better the quality the beef, the better this rice bowl will turn out.

Season with just some sea salt and black pepper. At home, it’s hard to replicate a proper charcoal fire yakiniku experience, so we settled for a grill pan. Though any pan will do, just that you can get nice grill marks from a grill pan.

Get the pan nice and hot, and simply cook it for a minute or less each side. Don’t add  oil especially for wagyu cuts as they have enough fat on it’s own, and don’t overcook. Beef this thin and good, you want to preserve the tender moist texture and flavours.

Once the beef is cooked, time to plate up. In a bowl of rice, layer the caramelised onions first, followed by placing the beef slices around the onions to form a mountain shape. See the video for this.

Get thick toasts for this though any normal white bread can still work. We using our homemade Hokkaido milk bread which is even more delicious.

First, trim off the crust edges. Use 2 slices for each hk toast. Spread smooth peanut butter on both slices, we using the healthy almond one from @scoopwholefoods_sg. Cover and make the egg coating.

Add 3 tbsp of fresh milk to 3 eggs and beat them well. Use a wide enough plate or pan that can hold the width of your toast. Get your oil hot and ready first before you coat as this is crucial.

Use a pot wide enough to hold the toast and allow it to turn on its sides. Heat up the oil to 150 Celsius. To test, drop a few drops of the egg coat and it should sizzle and fry into a batter almost instantly.

Set the stove to medium heat. Coat the toast with the egg solution on every side evenly. Each side only a few seconds as the idea is not to let it soak too much for too long. Once it’s all coated, immediately drop it into the pot of bubbling oil.

Each side should only take 30 seconds to get brown. You should get crusty fried egg shards on the sides, this will be so delicious! Use tongs to flip to the edges to get all 6 sides fully fried. On the last side, which should be the other flat side, set heat to maximum to get full deep fry mode. This will allow the toast not to get too much excess oil.

Drain the toast on paper towels to remove any last bit of oil. To finish, add a thick slice of cold butter and drizzle cold maple syrup on top and you are down!

Dragon Boat Festival is just around the corner and with saving costs foremost on our minds, we decided to make our own instead of buying from outside.

Start by soaking 500g glutinous rice, 12 chestnuts and bamboo leaves overnight. Also, soak about 6 dried mushrooms for 2 hours.

Marinate 250g pork shoulder or belly with 1 tbsp light soya, 1 tbsp dark soya, 1 tbsp sesame oil, 1 tbsp oyster sauce, 3 minced garlic, 1 chopped shallot and some 5 spice powder. Add a dash of white pepper also.

In a wok of oil, fry 3 minced garlic and 1 chopped shallot until fragrant. Add the glutinous rice and mix well. Season with 1 tbsp light soya, 1 tbsp dark soya, 1 tbsp sesame oil, 1 tbsp oyster sauce and some 5 spice powder. Stir until the rice is evenly coated, then set aside and let it cool down.

In a fresh wok of oil, fry another 3 minced garlic, a handful of dried shrimp and 1 chopped shallot until fragrant. Add the marinated pork, dried mushrooms and chestnuts. Fry and stir until everything is properly mixed. After about 5 minutes, set aside and let it cool down.

For each dumping take 2 bamboo leaves and fold at the center to form a triangle cup as seen in the video. Spoon some rice to fill one third of the capacity. Add a chestnut and a piece of pork.

Then add a chestnut, half a mushroom, some braised peanuts (from can) and half a salted egg yolk. You can also add an abalone as an option.

Fold the the flap of the lead to cover the base of the dumpling and fold in any other flap. Ensure it is tight and there are no gaps to form a taut pyramid shape.

We tie the dumpling strings to a hangar, but you can improvise with whatever is convenient. Use the string to tie around the dumpling and ensure it is tight. Make 12 dumplings with this recipe.

Then boil the dumplings in a wok of water for 45 minutes and it should be done. If you didn’t leave any gaps, the dumpling should look firm and neat.

2/6/2020,thesilverchef,"Pad Gaprao, or simply known as Thai Basil Minced Pork.

We often find this dish in Thai eateries, here’s how to make this simple dish at home. Gaprao is Thai for holy basil, which is different from the Italian basil we see in pasta. It has a more minty herbaceous aroma.

Start by making the sauce by adding together, 1 tbsp fish sauce, 1 tbsp light soya, 1 tbsp dark soya, 1 tbsp oyster sauce and 2 tbsp water. Optional add tbsp sugar. Mix well and set aside.

In a wok of hot oil, fry 2 minced garlic and 1 finely chopped chilli until they are fragrant. Add 200g to 250g minced pork and stir. Make sure to use a spatula to break out the meat to avoid clumps.

Once the meat has sufficiently browned, add the sauce and mix well until the meat is fully coated. Then add half a chopped onion and a handful of chopped long beans. Mix well again.

When the onions and long beans are soft, turn off the flame and add in a handful of Thai basil leaves. Toss quickly in the residual heat to somewhat blanche the basil. And that’s it, easy.

This is best eaten with white rice, so simply pour the Pad Gaprao over the rice and enjoy. It’s also nice to have a sunny side up egg with this too :))))) Check out my profile story highlights for the full video snippets.",913,18,"['That looks sooo good! 😋', 'Yummy 🤤', 'looks so yum 🤤🤤', 'Aroy. yummy😋', 'Oh my.

2/6/2020,thesilverchef,"Crispy Salmon, how to get it right.

Always pat dry your salmon before cooking it, and make sure it’s at room temperature. So, don’t take it out from the refrigerator too late.

Season with sea salt is best, as the courser particles will not dissolve that fast and make it overly salty. Season liberally also with both salt and black pepper on both sides. Salt will also help to extract any additional moisture, and that will help in making the skin crispy.

In a pan with a generous amount of oil at medium heat, always make sure the pan is well heated up before putting the fish in. And always start with skin side down, and a good non stick pan is best.

Slide the pan a bit to maw sure the skin is not sticking to the pan, and also only to turn the fish once. Fish like salmon only takes 4 to 5 minutes at most. Which means it should take not more than 2.5 minutes for each side, which is sufficient to crisp up the skin.

Once the skin side is crispy, flip the fish over and drop a spoon of butter which will melt very quickly. Use a spoon to baste the fish like what you see in the video.

Use a pair of tongs to feel the sides of the fish. It should feel firmer than when it was raw, but not too tough until it’s hard. Once you get that nice firm and toi toi texture, remove the fish from the heat and let it rest for a few minutes.

Your salmon skin will also dry off and you will end up with a perfectly seared and crispy skin, and a flaky and slightly pink and moist, tender flesh inside :))))) Check out my profile story highlights for the full video snippets.",1200,20,"['Love it!

Not your regular pancakes, this is really delicious and looks so good. You will need a cast iron pan or a pan that can be baked in an oven as most standard pans have materials that are not conducive in an oven.

Warm up half a cup of milk. In a whisking bowl, add 1/2 cup plain flour, 1/2 cup warmed milk, 2 large eggs, 1/2 tsp salt and 2 tbsp sugar. Whisk until you get a smooth batter.

Heat up your 9 inch cast iron skillet in an oven until it’s piping hot. Drop 2 tbsp butter into it and it will immediately fizzle. Use a spoon to wipe the butter all around the pan. Immediately pour in the batter and spread it evenly around the skillet.

Bake the pancake in the pan in a preheated oven at 220 Celsius no fan for around 15 minutes. After 10 minutes, it should puff up considerably. Ensure the center is properly cooked and set before removing it from the oven.

Once you take the pancake out, dust some icing sugar on the base before adding fruits of your choice. Then dust some more icing sugar and add some maple syrup and it’s done!

1/6/2020,thesilverchef,"Homemade Margherita Italian Pizza.

This is easy and cheap to do at home. Now, we won’t be able to achieve charred crusts like those found in Italian woodfire pizza joints, but this is a home oven version using fresh ingredients and making pizza dough from scratch.

Dissolve 1 tsp instant yeast to 160ml warm water. In a mixing bowl, add 250g plain flour and 1/2 tsp salt. Stir to mix well. Then slowly add the yeast mixture into the flour until they are fully integrated. Stir to form a shaggy dough.

Once you get that wet dough, pour it out onto a flour dusted table. Then knead until you form a smooth dough ball. Cover with a damp cloth and let it rest in a warm place for about 2 hours.

After resting, cut the dough into halves. Each half will make one pizza base. Shape each dough into another dough ball and then rest for another 2 hours. In the meantime, make the tomato sauce.

The best tomatoes are the ones from San Marzano, but it’s hard to get those. Either get a good Italian canned tomatoes, but if not, just get any canned ones will do. Blitz 3 or 4 canned tomatoes until it turns into a paste. Season with 1/2 tsp salt, some oregano and a dash of extra virgin olive oil.

After the dough ball has rested enough, place it on a flour dusted table again. Punch it down with your fist to flatten it. Then spread it out as much as you can. You can hold it in the air with both hands and just roll it like you see in the video.

Once it’s thin enough and it’s the size of a regular pizza shape, place the dough on a round baking pan. Spoon the tomato sauce onto the pizza base and spread it with the base of a ladle evenly.

Next, add balls of mozzarella cheese all around the pizza and some basil leaves. Bake it in a preheated oven at 250 Celsius or at your highest available temperature for 8 to 10 minutes. When the cheese has completely melted and has a light golden crust, remove from oven.

Serve it on a board or plate and cut it with a pizza cutter and enjoy!

To make this, there’s 2 ways. One is to use our previous Tom Yum broth, which you can find by scrolling through our feed. The other much easier way is to use this organic Tom Yum paste which you find via @shermayssingaporefinefood and the associated online grocer.

Dissolve 2 tsp of the Tom Yum into a cup of warm water. Then pour the mixture into a rice cooker filled with a cup of rice. Good enough for 2 persons.

You can also to add some optional ingredients to make it even more fragrant. Crush some lemongrass with the back of a knife and chop them. Add to the rice cooker. Cut some slices of galangal and add them too.

Simply set to rice cooker mode and let it cook till it is done. In the meantime, you can marinate about 6 deshelled and deveined tiger prawns with 1 tsp fish sauce and some white pepper. Prepare some broccoli and cherry tomatoes as accompaniments.

When the rice is cooked, open the rice cooker and add the broccoli and tomatoes and cook for 5 minutes. Then open again and add the prawns and cook for 3 to 5 minutes until they are pinkly cooked. Add a tsp of fish sauce around the rice also when you add the prawns.

When you see shabu shabu pork in supermarkets, don’t just think of using them for hotpot, as you will need to buy a bunch of other stuff just to do a hotpot. Instead here’s a simple rice bowl that’s fast and easy to whip up.

We are using the pork tricol roll from @yakiniku_plaza which you can go to for online home deliveries. They have a range of premium Japanese beef and pork items suited for simple yet tasty meals.

In a pan of oil at medium heat, sweat half a sliced onions until they are slightly charred, soft and translucent. Once they are soft, add your pork shabu into the mix. Use a pair of tongs to separate the pieces as they tend to stick together.

Once the meat is seared for about a minute or less, add 1 tbsp light soya (or 2 tbsp udon/soba sauce), 1 tbsp mirin, half tsp sugar and 2 tbsp water. Simmer for about a minute.

Turn the heat to low and add in one beaten egg and cover with lid for about 10 seconds. Open the lid and wait for the base of the egg to set and see that the egg is not watery. If it’s just moist, it will be fine as the egg will continue to cook on its own residual heat.

Pour the pork and egg mixture onto a bowl of white rice, preferably Japanese rice. Then garnish it with scallion and furikake and it’s done!

31/5/2020,thesilverchef,"Here’s a recap of that famous grilled cheese sandwich as seen in the movie, Chef. And boy, is this so stretchy good.

Butter both slices of a bread, we doing this with our own Hokkaido milk bread yields the best result. We use ghee here cos it’s clarified and mighty delicious, especially with our local QBB green tin brand.

In a pan of oil at low to medium heat, put both slices in simultaneously, buttered side faced down. Rub a little of the oil to prevent sticking. Immediately add the cheeses. We chose gouda, emental, cheddar and mozzarella, but you can go crazy with your own combinations.

After about a minute, cover your cheeses with the other slice and butter the top of it again with more butter. Yes, butter is marvelous here as it gives tremendous flavor. Then after another minute, flip over and toast the other side good.

Then after another minute, your cheeses should melt nicely. Now, if your bread is a bit thick like ours, do not fret if the cheese takes longer to melt. Simply send to the oven at 220 Celsius and toast for another 5 minutes with a foil wrap to get that final melting done.

Once the cheese has melted, then comes the really fun part. Cut into half and hear that symphony of crust crackling. Then, pull them apart for that cheesy stretch effect, fantastic for that instagram video.

But the true test is that first bite, crispy crackling of bread in your mouth up to your eardrums. And that combination of umami cheese goodness, and that buttery toast sensation.

30/5/2020,thesilverchef,"Crispy Salmon in Vegetable Broth.

Thanks to our friends at @greenies.sg, we had a bounty of vegetables and fruits today, and what’s fun about them is they also cut some of these veggies for you, making it easier to work with.

And the first thing we thought of to maximize such nice vegetables was to make a delicious vegetable broth to go with a crispy pan seared salmon. We will show the salmon searing technique separately so watch for this in a later post.

To make the stock, simply put in a slow cooker, a chopped onion, a few stalks of chopped celery, one chopped carrot and some white cabbage. Add water to fill up the pot and set to slow cook for at least 8 hours. You can do this in pot over a stove also, just be mindful to top up water every once in a while.

We will not eat or use the vegetables in the slow cooker. The veggies we use in the actual dish will be roasted instead, as they taste amazingly tasty sweet when you cook them this way.

Slice the vegetables very thinly so you can roast them quickly without burning them. Lay these potatoes neatly on a baking tray lined with aluminum foil. Potatoes, carrots, celery, broccoli and beetroot.

Season them with sea salt and drizzle with olive oil. Roast in the oven at 200 Celsius for between 10 to 12 minutes until they are soft enough. Be mindful not to cook them too long as they will burn.

Cook the salmon. To plate, simply place the roasted vegetables in a nice fashion like what is seen in the video. Place the salmon on top. Then use a serving pot to pour in the broth like how they do it in a fine dining restaurant. The beetroot will also slowly give the broth a bright Ferrari red colour. And voila, a beautiful delicious salmon in vegetables broth dish.

This way, we can still enjoy a really fine dining dish at home :))))) Check out my profile story highlights for the full video snippets, and wait for the separate salmon video later.",461,4,"['That skin looks🔥', 'Yummmm😋😋😋', '😘😘😘']"

Soak 100g of glutinous rice for 2 hours. Also soak 2 dried Chinese mushrooms for an hour and retain the mushroom water. Boil a lup cheong or Chinese sausage for a minute to help to remove the skin easily.

Dice the sausage, along with a clove of garlic. In a wok of oil, dry the garlic, sausage and a handful of dried shrimp until it’s temptingly aromatic.

Then add the glutinous rice and mix well. Season with 1 tsp light soya, 1 tsp dark soya, 1 tsp sesame oil, 1 tsp Chinese wine and some white pepper. Stir well.

Spoon the rice into each squid and make sure they are evenly distributed along the length of the squid body. Do not stuff too tightly also as the squid will shrink, just ensure there’s enough ratio of rice to squid inside.

Sprinkle some chopped scallion and garlic. Drizzle a simple sauce comprising of 3 tsp water, 1 tsp light soya, 1/2 tsp sesame oil and 1/2 tsp Chinese wine. Then steam the squid for 4 or 5 minutes as squid cooks very fast.
