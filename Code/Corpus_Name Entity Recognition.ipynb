Those of you who love Tau Sar Pau would immediately recognize this style of Tau Sar Pau made famous by Forty Hands.

They are actually imported from JB and they are recognized by their distinctive flat disc shape and smooth tau sar. At 6 for $7.90, they actually cost more than our local variety but no one is complaining as they are less than half the price of the ones sold at the cafe!\\r\\n\\r\\nI think they are nice but to be honest, these paus have never really blown me away. However, the skin is light and fluffy and their 8 hr slow cooked, de-hulled tau sar is smooth and not too sweet. I have always been prejudiced by their factory made look, but they do stand out as a tau sar pau which is easily recognizable. Sadly, our local tau sar pau are all pretty generic except for perhaps the ones at Joo Huat  http://bit.ly/ieatJooHuatPau who still make their own tau sar. Their Liu Sar paus are also quite nice, albeit also looking very factory made.

It is the best thing that has been delivered to our doorstep since CB started. Their laksa is also really good. Definitely a notch above the hawker version. It’s chock full of seafood like prawns, scallop dumplings  and mussels and the gravy is full of dried prawns, aromatic rempah, laksa leaves and freshly squeezed coconut. The har cheong gai would have been excellent fresh but they were already soft when they arrived, but the surprise was that they have been deboned, so it was really easy to eat. The chicken rice was the only dish I felt ambivalent about. Don’t compare it with the local version as it is supposed to be a claypot “ANG MOH” version that his grandma used to make which comes with a creamy mushroom sauce that tasted a bit like Chicken Ala King. \\r\\nOverall, the quality of the food is very good. The team are doing a great job making ultimate versions of our local dishes. Yes, they are more expensive than the hawker version but it wouldn’t be fair to compare their pricing with the hawkers.

Drenched in a thick, rich chilli crab sauce that has egg strands in it, this was a massive crab. The crab claws are cracked beforehand, so it’s simply a matter of scooping out the sweet, juicy crabmeat.

The subs came in cardboard boxes which reminded me of those you might spot at a food festival. Each sub came with a side of plain nachos, in case you want to dip into the bountiful toppings sitting atop your sub.\\r\\n.\\r\\nSuper Sub had a plethora of gourmet options, and I decided to try some of their more famous toppings. Super Sub’s Fiery Chic Bolognese (S$7.80) is one of their best-sellers, and for good reason. Topped with lettuce, cherry tomatoes, jalapeno, mayonnaise and cheddar cheese, this tomato-based sub may look rather unassuming at first glance as compared to the others.\\r\\n.\\r\\nHowever, this turned out to be my favourite. The slightly spicy meat sauce was absolutely delicious and it went extremely well with the chicken hotdog.

It only takes 10 minutes, so it’s great for a #StayHome lunch on a busy workday.\\r\\n.\\r\\nThe best part about this recipe is that you can adjust the ingredient quantities according to your preference.

Season with 1 tsp salt.\\r\\n\\r\\nKeep repeating until the rice puffs up and is not too hard nor too mushy, about 20 minutes or so. Around 15 minutes, add some green peas. Once the rice is fully cooked, turn off the flame and add in a 2 thick slabs of butter, grated parmesan or parmigiana.\\r\\n\\r\\nStir well to emulsify the butter and toss to get it super creamy and delicious like seen in the video.

Once the chicken is cooked in a few minutes, add 2 stalks of chopped scallion, 4 cloves of garlic that have been peeled and cut into halves and 6 slices of ginger. Toss and stir well again, it should smell incredibly aromatic by now.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext add the sauce which will give the chicken a shiny gloss like the livery on an F1 car. Keep tossing. The last part is to simply add baked or cooked cashew nuts for a lovely crunch.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo serve, you can pour it on a sharing plate or do what we did here, that is to spoon the chicken onto a bowl of piping hot white rice.

It’s using a combination of rice, three parts normal rice (preferably Japanese or Taiwanese rice) to one part glutinous rice. So for 2 persons, you need half cup rice in total, so mix well 3/8 cup of normal rice to 1/8 cup glutinous rice. Then you always need 8 times more water, in this case 4 cups of water or stock for even a better flavour profile.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo add the 2 types rice and water into the rice cooker. As we are using garoupa as our protein later, we flavour this congee with one slice of dried abalone and a few pieces of dried scallops for that ocean taste. Then set your rice cooker to cook for 3.5 hours for maximum congee joy.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn hour into cooking, add a few slices of ginger and some white bits of scallion. Marinate 150g mince pork with 3 slices ginger, 2 chopped garlic, 1/2 tsp salt, 1 tsp Chinese wine, 1 tsp sesame oil, 1 tsp 5 spice powder, 1 tsp plain flour and a dash of white pepper. Mix well and let it rest for 5 minutes.\\r\\n\\r\\nHalf an hour before the congee time is up, simply add the pork balls and sliced century eggs into the rice cooker. And once the congee is fully cooked, season with one tsp salt. You can add more if you prefer a stronger taste.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo serve, pour into large round bowls and garnish with more slices of ginger and the green bits of scallion. Then it should look similar to those you find at you know where. The texture should be silky and velvety, and the rice fairly broken down from the long cooking time. It should taste thoroughly comforting too :))))) Check out my profile story highlights for the full video snippets.', 'Egg Mayonnaise Prosciutto Wrap.\\r\\n\\r\\nA tasty breakfast favourite of ours, this takes half an hour to do and less than half that time to eat.\\r\\n\\r\\nBring 3 eggs to a boil, then turn off heat.

Deshell and devein the shrimp and separate them. Boil tagliatelle from @barilla for exactly 5 minutes and strain. Keep the pasta water.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a pan of oil, lightly sauté the prawns on each side. Prawns cook very fast, so it will take only a minute or so to cook. Remove but use the same pan to cook the heads until they turn pink. Then add 2 ladles of pasta water and simmer for 5 minutes. Strain and keep the prawn stock.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a pan, drizzle enough extra virgin olive oil to create a thin film of bathing oil. Add 2 cloves of thinly sliced garlic and 6 cherry tomatoes, halved. Let them bathe in the oil to make an aromatic garlic oil. Next add some chopped basil, be sure to keep another batch of same amount of basil for the finishing later.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdd a tbsp butter and let it monte the pan. In French cooking, monte usually comes at the end to make the sauce more rich and luxurious, but we are using butter to add flavour and richness. As the butter is melted, add the prawn stock to make the final sauce.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce the sauce is boiling, add the pasta and quickly stir to get the pasta to absorb all the prawn and basil goodness. If you can toss the noodles, even better. The secret here is to make the pasta absorb the saucy liquid until it reduces to a creamy consistency.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo finish, turn off heat and add the prawns and the balance of basil and another tbsp of butter and monte or mantecare one last time. Stirring and tossing adds air to emulsify the butter into the sauce, giving it a rich creamy and glossy finish.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo serve, refer to our videos to see how it can be plated nicely.

Use the string to tie around the dumpling and ensure it is tight. Make 12 dumplings with this recipe.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen boil the dumplings in a wok of water for 45 minutes and it should be done.

Avoid spending money on expensive Wagyu for this, an Aussie angus will do nicely.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext, make sure your steak is at room temperature before you cook it, and pat dry on both sides so that there is no excess moisture. Then, season liberally with sea salt or course salt. Do likewise with black pepper.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe issue with most home cooked steaks is usually the pan is not hot enough, and you don’t get that golden crust. So make sure you heat up your pan with a shallow film of oil for a few minutes before you put the meat in.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou must get a beautiful sizzling sound when the beef hits the pan, and just leave it. You only need to turn once. After about 2 minutes, turn and you should get a nice golden brown crust. Add a tbsp butter and baste, which means using a spoon and quickly take some butter juice and pour over the top of the steak repeatedly as seen in the video. Cook for another 2 minutes.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor most ribeye and striploin cuts, the entire steak can usually cook in just the pan, but tenderloin and thicker cuts may need an extra time in the oven. If so, send the steak to the oven at 180 Celsius for another 2 to 3 minutes.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce the steak is cooked to medium rare, you need to rest it for another 3 minutes or so. Make sure you don’t forget this as if not, your steak will not be as juicy. Once it’s properly rested, take a sharp knife and you should easily cut through the steak like butter.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou should get a ideal pink medium rare, and a juicy and tender texture. The basting will give it a lovely buttery beef flavour, and every bite should be nirvana for steak lovers :)))))', 'Feeling a bit heavy over the last week with our diet, tonight we revert back to our light soup nights as eating clean is always important.\\r\\n\\r\\nA simple pork ribs watercress soup cooked for 10 hours is just the tonic to detox and nourish :)))))', 'Homemade Nasi Lemak.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere’s our little take on this popular breakfast classic.

It’s using a combination of rice, three parts normal rice (preferably Japanese or Taiwanese rice) to one part glutinous rice. So for 2 persons, you need half cup rice in total, so mix well 3/8 cup of normal rice to 1/8 cup glutinous rice. Then you always need 8 times more water, in this case 4 cups of water or stock for even a better flavour profile.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo add the 2 types rice and water into the rice cooker. As we are using garoupa as our protein later, we flavour this congee with one slice of dried abalone and a few pieces of dried scallops for that ocean taste. Then set your rice cooker to cook for 3.5 hours for maximum congee joy.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn hour into cooking, add a few slices of ginger and some white bits of scallion. Marinate 150g mince pork with 3 slices ginger, 2 chopped garlic, 1/2 tsp salt, 1 tsp Chinese wine, 1 tsp sesame oil, 1 tsp 5 spice powder, 1 tsp plain flour and a dash of white pepper. Mix well and let it rest for 5 minutes.\\r\\n\\r\\nHalf an hour before the congee time is up, simply add the pork balls and sliced century eggs into the rice cooker. And once the congee is fully cooked, season with one tsp salt. You can add more if you prefer a stronger taste.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo serve, pour into large round bowls and garnish with more slices of ginger and the green bits of scallion. Then it should look similar to those you find at you know where. The texture should be silky and velvety, and the rice fairly broken down from the long cooking time. It should taste thoroughly comforting too :))))) Check out my profile story highlights for the full video snippets.', 'Egg Mayonnaise Prosciutto Wrap.\\r\\n\\r\\nA tasty breakfast favourite of ours, this takes half an hour to do and less than half that time to eat.\\r\\n\\r\\nBring 3 eggs to a boil, then turn off heat.

Deshell and devein the shrimp and separate them. Boil tagliatelle from @barilla for exactly 5 minutes and strain. Keep the pasta water.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a pan of oil, lightly sauté the prawns on each side. Prawns cook very fast, so it will take only a minute or so to cook. Remove but use the same pan to cook the heads until they turn pink. Then add 2 ladles of pasta water and simmer for 5 minutes. Strain and keep the prawn stock.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a pan, drizzle enough extra virgin olive oil to create a thin film of bathing oil. Add 2 cloves of thinly sliced garlic and 6 cherry tomatoes, halved. Let them bathe in the oil to make an aromatic garlic oil. Next add some chopped basil, be sure to keep another batch of same amount of basil for the finishing later.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdd a tbsp butter and let it monte the pan. In French cooking, monte usually comes at the end to make the sauce more rich and luxurious, but we are using butter to add flavour and richness. As the butter is melted, add the prawn stock to make the final sauce.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce the sauce is boiling, add the pasta and quickly stir to get the pasta to absorb all the prawn and basil goodness. If you can toss the noodles, even better. The secret here is to make the pasta absorb the saucy liquid until it reduces to a creamy consistency.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo finish, turn off heat and add the prawns and the balance of basil and another tbsp of butter and monte or mantecare one last time. Stirring and tossing adds air to emulsify the butter into the sauce, giving it a rich creamy and glossy finish.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo serve, refer to our videos to see how it can be plated nicely.

Avoid spending money on expensive Wagyu for this, an Aussie angus will do nicely.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext, make sure your steak is at room temperature before you cook it, and pat dry on both sides so that there is no excess moisture. Then, season liberally with sea salt or course salt. Do likewise with black pepper.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe issue with most home cooked steaks is usually the pan is not hot enough, and you don’t get that golden crust. So make sure you heat up your pan with a shallow film of oil for a few minutes before you put the meat in.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou must get a beautiful sizzling sound when the beef hits the pan, and just leave it. You only need to turn once. After about 2 minutes, turn and you should get a nice golden brown crust. Add a tbsp butter and baste, which means using a spoon and quickly take some butter juice and pour over the top of the steak repeatedly as seen in the video. Cook for another 2 minutes.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor most ribeye and striploin cuts, the entire steak can usually cook in just the pan, but tenderloin and thicker cuts may need an extra time in the oven. If so, send the steak to the oven at 180 Celsius for another 2 to 3 minutes.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce the steak is cooked to medium rare, you need to rest it for another 3 minutes or so. Make sure you don’t forget this as if not, your steak will not be as juicy. Once it’s properly rested, take a sharp knife and you should easily cut through the steak like butter.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou should get a ideal pink medium rare, and a juicy and tender texture. The basting will give it a lovely buttery beef flavour, and every bite should be nirvana for steak lovers :)))))', 'Feeling a bit heavy over the last week with our diet, tonight we revert back to our light soup nights as eating clean is always important.\\r\\n\\r\\nA simple pork ribs watercress soup cooked for 10 hours is just the tonic to detox and nourish :)))))', 'Homemade Nasi Lemak.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere’s our little take on this popular breakfast classic.

As there is some fat on the beef, no oil is needed.\\r\\n\\r\\nSteaks with this thickness usually take about 3 minutes to cook fully, so you should flip around the 1.5 minutes mark. As you need around that much time to get a nice crust and grill marks too, so the best doneness is medium pink.\\r\\n\\r\\nNaturally we always hear from TV cooking shows that medium rare is the best doneness, but that’s for thicker cuts like thick striploin and tenderloin. Thinner cuts, we need to weigh getting better crusts for flavour against getting that medium rare texture.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe also didn’t baste the steak today as this is old school western Hainanese style we shooting for, so we added the slab of butter after we placed the cooked steak on a plate. Simply add the slab of butter on top of the steak.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs an added touch, we spooned some white truffle pate from @shinsengrocer as well, for that extra oomph.

Then bake in an oven at 180 Celsius for about 15 minutes or so until the fish is fully cooked.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen it’s done, simply transfer to a serving plate and remove the toothpicks and top leaf.

Avoid spending money on expensive Wagyu for this, an Aussie angus will do nicely.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext, make sure your steak is at room temperature before you cook it, and pat dry on both sides so that there is no excess moisture. Then, season liberally with sea salt or course salt. Do likewise with black pepper.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe issue with most home cooked steaks is usually the pan is not hot enough, and you don’t get that golden crust. So make sure you heat up your pan with a shallow film of oil for a few minutes before you put the meat in.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou must get a beautiful sizzling sound when the beef hits the pan, and just leave it. You only need to turn once. After about 2 minutes, turn and you should get a nice golden brown crust. Add a tbsp butter and baste, which means using a spoon and quickly take some butter juice and pour over the top of the steak repeatedly as seen in the video. Cook for another 2 minutes.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor most ribeye and striploin cuts, the entire steak can usually cook in just the pan, but tenderloin and thicker cuts may need an extra time in the oven. If so, send the steak to the oven at 180 Celsius for another 2 to 3 minutes.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce the steak is cooked to medium rare, you need to rest it for another 3 minutes or so. Make sure you don’t forget this as if not, your steak will not be as juicy. Once it’s properly rested, take a sharp knife and you should easily cut through the steak like butter.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou should get a ideal pink medium rare, and a juicy and tender texture. The basting will give it a lovely buttery beef flavour, and every bite should be nirvana for steak lovers :)))))', 'Feeling a bit heavy over the last week with our diet, tonight we revert back to our light soup nights as eating clean is always important.\\r\\n\\r\\nA simple pork ribs watercress soup cooked for 10 hours is just the tonic to detox and nourish :)))))', 'Homemade Nasi Lemak.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere’s our little take on this popular breakfast classic.

You won’t get the lovely grill marks without the grill pan do.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe steak from @shinsengrocer comes pre seasoned so you just need to heat up the pan until it’s very hot before you add it in. As there is some fat on the beef, no oil is needed.\\r\\n\\r\\nSteaks with this thickness usually take about 3 minutes to cook fully, so you should flip around the 1.5 minutes mark. As you need around that much time to get a nice crust and grill marks too, so the best doneness is medium pink.\\r\\n\\r\\nNaturally we always hear from TV cooking shows that medium rare is the best doneness, but that’s for thicker cuts like thick striploin and tenderloin. Thinner cuts, we need to weigh getting better crusts for flavour against getting that medium rare texture.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe also didn’t baste the steak today as this is old school western Hainanese style we shooting for, so we added the slab of butter after we placed the cooked steak on a plate. Simply add the slab of butter on top of the steak.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs an added touch, we spooned some white truffle pate from @shinsengrocer as well, for that extra oomph. Garnish with some vegetables of your selection on the side.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen you eat, simply wipe that butter all over the steak before cutting into it.

Season with 1 tsp salt and add some water if it gets too dry.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn a baking tray lined with aluminium foil, place one complete banana leave on top as the base for this fish. You can get the leaves from @redmartcom.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlace your seabass or any white fish on top. You can use a fillet or if it’s big enough to fit on the leaf, an entire fish. Spread the cooked spicy paste on top of the fish.\\r\\n\\r\\nCover with another banana leaf and secure the sides and edges with toothpicks. Refer to the video for this. Then bake in an oven at 180 Celsius for about 15 minutes or so until the fish is fully cooked.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen it’s done, simply transfer to a serving plate and remove the toothpicks and top leaf.

Break two eggs and whisk like there’s no tomorrow hehe. This is to introduce air into the mixture and after a few minutes, the mixture will start to foam and turn paler, and will have more liquid. This is a much better way to use your whisking muscles than to make some diabetic Korean kopi C which we will also never make here hehe.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce the egg mixture is foamy and has a nice viscosity, add the 80g flour and half tsp baking powder and stir subtly until it foams into a nice yellow and eggy batter. Refrigerate for 15 minutes and after taking it out, add one tbsp plain water just to loosen the batter.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe used our homemade red bean paste from a few days ago, but you can use pre-made ones as well. Add a little oil and stir well to smooth out the filling.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a non stick pan, pour a ladle of egg batter into the centre and let it naturally spread out to form a round pancake shape. It will cook very quickly in a minute or two, so use a spatula to loosen the edges and get ready to flip.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce it’s dry on the bottom side, quickly flip and cook the other side, which will tend to cook faster as the pan gets hotter. Make two pieces for each dorayaki sandwich. \\r\\nOnce done, spoon some red bean filling on one piece and cover with another piece to form a sandwich. Use a cling wrap to tightly wrap around the dorayaki to get the chubby UFO shape.

And as an optional extra, we are using smoked bratwurst though bacon or luncheon meat will do just as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nHave some cooked rice ready, and contrary to popular belief, you don’t need to use overnight rice. What you can do is to cook the rice a few hours in advance, and once it’s cook, open the lid and let it dry out for an hour to 2. The key is to remove any excess moisture so that the rice won’t be clumpy when fried.\\r\\n\\r\\nStart in a wok with some oil and fry the meat chopped in small dices. Fry a few minutes until it’s lightly browned. If your kimchi is still in large pieces, make sure to cut them into smaller and thinner slices beforehand.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdd the kimchi, as to how much it’s up to you. We would suggest about 2 handfuls should be sufficient but go crazy with more if you adore the Korean pickled cabbage.\\r\\n\\r\\nStir and mix well with the meat. We add a canned tomato and some of the juices to give it some hearty acidity, but you can substitute with Korean gochujang sauce for an extra spicy kick.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext add the rice and stir well. Use a spatula to break up any clumpy rice and get every grain properly coated with the kimchi sauce. It should look bright red when it’s done. \\r\\nAdd a dash of sesame oil and chopped scallion. Turn off the flame and serve. We are using a shallow cast iron pan as it resembles those metal pans that Korean places usually use.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor garnishing, cut a dried seaweed sheet into very thin strips and place in the center of the rice.

So, don’t take it out from the refrigerator too late.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeason with sea salt is best, as the courser particles will not dissolve that fast and make it overly salty. Season liberally also with both salt and black pepper on both sides. Salt will also help to extract any additional moisture, and that will help in making the skin crispy.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a pan with a generous amount of oil at medium heat, always make sure the pan is well heated up before putting the fish in. And always start with skin side down, and a good non stick pan is best.\\r\\n\\r\\nSlide the pan a bit to maw sure the skin is not sticking to the pan, and also only to turn the fish once. Fish like salmon only takes 4 to 5 minutes at most. Which means it should take not more than 2.5 minutes for each side, which is sufficient to crisp up the skin.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce the skin side is crispy, flip the fish over and drop a spoon of butter which will melt very quickly. Use a spoon to baste the fish like what you see in the video.\\r\\n\\r\\nUse a pair of tongs to feel the sides of the fish. It should feel firmer than when it was raw, but not too tough until it’s hard. Once you get that nice firm and toi toi texture, remove the fish from the heat and let it rest for a few minutes.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour salmon skin will also dry off and you will end up with a perfectly seared and crispy skin, and a flaky and slightly pink and moist, tender flesh inside :))))) Check out my profile story highlights for the full video snippets.', 'Dutch Baby Pancake.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot your regular pancakes, this is really delicious and looks so good.

To finish, add a thick slice of cold butter and drizzle cold maple syrup on top and you are down! It may be called French toast, and as much as I regard French cooking, this is one thing that Asians are much better at pulling off :))))) Check out my profile story highlights for the full video snippets.', 'Bak Zhang Rice Dumplings.\\r\\n\\r\\nDragon Boat Festival is just around the corner and with saving costs foremost on our minds, we decided to make our own instead of buying from outside.\\r\\n\\r\\nStart by soaking 500g glutinous rice, 12 chestnuts and bamboo leaves overnight. Also, soak about 6 dried mushrooms for 2 hours.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarinate 250g pork shoulder or belly with 1 tbsp light soya, 1 tbsp dark soya, 1 tbsp sesame oil, 1 tbsp oyster sauce, 3 minced garlic, 1 chopped shallot and some 5 spice powder. Add a dash of white pepper also.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a wok of oil, fry 3 minced garlic and 1 chopped shallot until fragrant. Add the glutinous rice and mix well. Season with 1 tbsp light soya, 1 tbsp dark soya, 1 tbsp sesame oil, 1 tbsp oyster sauce and some 5 spice powder. Stir until the rice is evenly coated, then set aside and let it cool down.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a fresh wok of oil, fry another 3 minced garlic, a handful of dried shrimp and 1 chopped shallot until fragrant. Add the marinated pork, dried mushrooms and chestnuts. Fry and stir until everything is properly mixed. After about 5 minutes, set aside and let it cool down.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor each dumping take 2 bamboo leaves and fold at the center to form a triangle cup as seen in the video. Spoon some rice to fill one third of the capacity. Add a chestnut and a piece of pork.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen add a chestnut, half a mushroom, some braised peanuts (from can) and half a salted egg yolk. You can also add an abalone as an option.\\r\\n\\r\\nFold the the flap of the lead to cover the base of the dumpling and fold in any other flap. Ensure it is tight and there are no gaps to form a taut pyramid shape.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe tie the dumpling strings to a hangar, but you can improvise with whatever is convenient. Use the string to tie around the dumpling and ensure it is tight. Make 12 dumplings with this recipe.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen boil the dumplings in a wok of water for 45 minutes and it should be done. If you didn’t leave any gaps, the dumpling should look firm and neat.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe still need more practice with our dumpling tying skills, but this way is certainly more affordable than buying commercial ones outside. And equally as tasty :))))) Check out my profile story highlights for the full video snippets', 'After cooking exclusively at home and making all our meals for 2 months, we decided to mark the end of cb with a meal from outside.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd thanks to our friends from @songfabkt, we had a marvelous Bak Kut Teh lunch with braised pig triggers and fried you tiao. When it comes to bkt, we still defer to them as they still have a fine balance of savoury, meaty, garlicky and peppery notes without being over-sweet.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd also, we are busy with making something today that we thought to take it easy for lunch :)))))', 'Cone Bread Rolls.\\r\\n\\r\\nFreshly baked bread is the best thing to wake up to!

Gaprao is Thai for holy basil, which is different from the Italian basil we see in pasta. It has a more minty herbaceous aroma.\\r\\n\\r\\nStart by making the sauce by adding together, 1 tbsp fish sauce, 1 tbsp light soya, 1 tbsp dark soya, 1 tbsp oyster sauce and 2 tbsp water. Optional add tbsp sugar. Mix well and set aside.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a wok of hot oil, fry 2 minced garlic and 1 finely chopped chilli until they are fragrant. Add 200g to 250g minced pork and stir. Make sure to use a spatula to break out the meat to avoid clumps.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce the meat has sufficiently browned, add the sauce and mix well until the meat is fully coated. Then add half a chopped onion and a handful of chopped long beans. Mix well again.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the onions and long beans are soft, turn off the flame and add in a handful of Thai basil leaves. Toss quickly in the residual heat to somewhat blanche the basil. And that’s it, easy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is best eaten with white rice, so simply pour the Pad Gaprao over the rice and enjoy. It’s also nice to have a sunny side up egg with this too :))))) Check out my profile story highlights for the full video snippets.', 'Crispy Salmon, how to get it right.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlways pat dry your salmon before cooking it, and make sure it’s at room temperature. So, don’t take it out from the refrigerator too late.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeason with sea salt is best, as the courser particles will not dissolve that fast and make it overly salty. Season liberally also with both salt and black pepper on both sides. Salt will also help to extract any additional moisture, and that will help in making the skin crispy.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a pan with a generous amount of oil at medium heat, always make sure the pan is well heated up before putting the fish in. And always start with skin side down, and a good non stick pan is best.\\r\\n\\r\\nSlide the pan a bit to maw sure the skin is not sticking to the pan, and also only to turn the fish once. Fish like salmon only takes 4 to 5 minutes at most. Which means it should take not more than 2.5 minutes for each side, which is sufficient to crisp up the skin.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce the skin side is crispy, flip the fish over and drop a spoon of butter which will melt very quickly. Use a spoon to baste the fish like what you see in the video.\\r\\n\\r\\nUse a pair of tongs to feel the sides of the fish. It should feel firmer than when it was raw, but not too tough until it’s hard. Once you get that nice firm and toi toi texture, remove the fish from the heat and let it rest for a few minutes.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour salmon skin will also dry off and you will end up with a perfectly seared and crispy skin, and a flaky and slightly pink and moist, tender flesh inside :))))) Check out my profile story highlights for the full video snippets.', 'Dutch Baby Pancake.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot your regular pancakes, this is really delicious and looks so good. You will need a cast iron pan or a pan that can be baked in an oven as most standard pans have materials that are not conducive in an oven.\\r\\n\\r\\nWarm up half a cup of milk. In a whisking bowl, add 1/2 cup plain flour, 1/2 cup warmed milk, 2 large eggs, 1/2 tsp salt and 2 tbsp sugar. Whisk until you get a smooth batter.\\r\\n\\r\\nHeat up your 9 inch cast iron skillet in an oven until it’s piping hot. Drop 2 tbsp butter into it and it will immediately fizzle. Use a spoon to wipe the butter all around the pan. Immediately pour in the batter and spread it evenly around the skillet.\\r\\n\\r\\nBake the pancake in the pan in a preheated oven at 220 Celsius no fan for around 15 minutes. After 10 minutes, it should puff up considerably. Ensure the center is properly cooked and set before removing it from the oven.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce you take the pancake out, dust some icing sugar on the base before adding fruits of your choice. Then dust some more icing sugar and add some maple syrup and it’s done! Delicious and full of fruit vitamins :))))) Check out my profile story highlights for the full video snippets.', 'Homemade Margherita Italian Pizza.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is easy and cheap to do at home. Now, we won’t be able to achieve charred crusts like those found in Italian woodfire pizza joints, but this is a home oven version using fresh ingredients and making pizza dough from scratch.\\r\\n\\r\\nDissolve 1 tsp instant yeast to 160ml warm water. In a mixing bowl, add 250g plain flour and 1/2 tsp salt. Stir to mix well. Then slowly add the yeast mixture into the flour until they are fully integrated. Stir to form a shaggy dough.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce you get that wet dough, pour it out onto a flour dusted table. Then knead until you form a smooth dough ball. Cover with a damp cloth and let it rest in a warm place for about 2 hours.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter resting, cut the dough into halves. Each half will make one pizza base. Shape each dough into another dough ball and then rest for another 2 hours. In the meantime, make the tomato sauce.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe best tomatoes are the ones from San Marzano, but it’s hard to get those. Either get a good Italian canned tomatoes, but if not, just get any canned ones will do. Blitz 3 or 4 canned tomatoes until it turns into a paste. Season with 1/2 tsp salt, some oregano and a dash of extra virgin olive oil.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the dough ball has rested enough, place it on a flour dusted table again. Punch it down with your fist to flatten it. Then spread it out as much as you can. You can hold it in the air with both hands and just roll it like you see in the video.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce it’s thin enough and it’s the size of a regular pizza shape, place the dough on a round baking pan. Spoon the tomato sauce onto the pizza base and spread it with the base of a ladle evenly.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext, add balls of mozzarella cheese all around the pizza and some basil leaves. Bake it in a preheated oven at 250 Celsius or at your highest available temperature for 8 to 10 minutes. When the cheese has completely melted and has a light golden crust, remove from oven.\\r\\n\\r\\nServe it on a board or plate and cut it with a pizza cutter and enjoy!

They have a range of premium Japanese beef and pork items suited for simple yet tasty meals.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a pan of oil at medium heat, sweat half a sliced onions until they are slightly charred, soft and translucent.

And boy, is this so stretchy good.\\r\\n\\r\\nButter both slices of a bread, we doing this with our own Hokkaido milk bread yields the best result. We use ghee here cos it’s clarified and mighty delicious, especially with our local QBB green tin brand.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a pan of oil at low to medium heat, put both slices in simultaneously, buttered side faced down. Rub a little of the oil to prevent sticking. Immediately add the cheeses. We chose gouda, emental, cheddar and mozzarella, but you can go crazy with your own combinations.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter about a minute, cover your cheeses with the other slice and butter the top of it again with more butter. Yes, butter is marvelous here as it gives tremendous flavor. Then after another minute, flip over and toast the other side good.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen after another minute, your cheeses should melt nicely. Now, if your bread is a bit thick like ours, do not fret if the cheese takes longer to melt. Simply send to the oven at 220 Celsius and toast for another 5 minutes with a foil wrap to get that final melting done.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce the cheese has melted, then comes the really fun part. Cut into half and hear that symphony of crust crackling.

We will show the salmon searing technique separately so watch for this in a later post.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo make the stock, simply put in a slow cooker, a chopped onion, a few stalks of chopped celery, one chopped carrot and some white cabbage. Add water to fill up the pot and set to slow cook for at least 8 hours. You can do this in pot over a stove also, just be mindful to top up water every once in a while.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe will not eat or use the vegetables in the slow cooker. The veggies we use in the actual dish will be roasted instead, as they taste amazingly tasty sweet when you cook them this way.\\r\\n\\r\\nSlice the vegetables very thinly so you can roast them quickly without burning them. Lay these potatoes neatly on a baking tray lined with aluminum foil. Potatoes, carrots, celery, broccoli and beetroot.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeason them with sea salt and drizzle with olive oil. Roast in the oven at 200 Celsius for between 10 to 12 minutes until they are soft enough. Be mindful not to cook them too long as they will burn.\\r\\n\\r\\nCook the salmon. To plate, simply place the roasted vegetables in a nice fashion like what is seen in the video. Place the salmon on top. Then use a serving pot to pour in the broth like how they do it in a fine dining restaurant. The beetroot will also slowly give the broth a bright Ferrari red colour. And voila, a beautiful delicious salmon in vegetables broth dish.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis way, we can still enjoy a really fine dining dish at home :))))) Check out my profile story highlights for the full video snippets, and wait for the separate salmon video later.', 'Stuffed Squid with Glutinous Rice.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoak 100g of glutinous rice for 2 hours.
